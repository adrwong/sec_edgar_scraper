PART I
Item1.
Business
COMPANY OVERVIEW
Unless the context otherwise indicates or requires, as used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms we, our, us, ADS and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. refer to Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and its directly- and indirectly-owned subsidiaries as a combined entity, except where it is clear that the terms mean only Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. exclusive of its subsidiaries. 
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or HDPE) pipe, polypropylene (or PP) pipe and related water management products. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s national sales and distribution platform, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall product breadth and scale and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing excellence. In the United States, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s national footprint combined with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the ADS brand has long been associated with quality products and market-leading performance. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarked green stripe, which is prominently displayed on many of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products, serves as clear identification of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s commitment to the customers and markets we serve. 
We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity. For fiscal 2017, we generated net sales of $1,257.3 million, net income of $35.9million and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) of $193.4 million and, as of March31, 2017, we had $350.4 million of total outstanding debt. For a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data. We believe ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s extensive national footprint in the United States creates a cost and service advantage versus ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s HDPE pipe producing competitors, the largest of which has only 11 domestic HDPE pipe manufacturing plants and, according to the July25, 2016 ranking by Plastics News of Pipe, Profile Tubing Extruders, recently had estimated sales of $140million, or approximately nine times less than ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales in fiscal 2017.

Fiscal Year 2017 Revenue
RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
In February 2017, we acquired the assets of Plastic Tubing Industries (PTI), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories, in an all cash transaction for $9.5 million. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. With the acquisition, we will increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to existing manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
For a discussion of segment and geographic information, see Note 21. Business Segment Information to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM
We have a leading domestic and international manufacturing and distribution infrastructure, serving customers in all 50 U.S. states as well as approximately 80 other countries through 60 manufacturing plants and 34 distribution centers, including 7 manufacturing plants and 6 distribution centers owned or leased by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint ventures. We manufacture ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s corrugated pipe products in 17 different diameters ranging from 2 to 60 using a continuous extrusion process, where molten polyethylene or polypropylene is pushed through a die into a moving series of corrugated U-shaped molds. Blown air and vacuum are used to form the corrugations of the pipe which is pulled through a corrugator and then cut to length. We utilize customized and proprietary production equipment, which we believe is faster and more cost efficient than other pipe making equipment generally available in the market.
Domestically, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is capable of producing more than one billion pounds of pipe annually on a standard five-day per week schedule. Additional capacity is in place to support seasonal production needs and growth in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s N-12 pipe sales volume requiring minimal additional capital for molds. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s normal production capacity utilization as a percentage of total capacity was 67%, 70% and 68% for fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s production equipment is built to accept transportable molds and die tooling over a certain range of sizes so each plant is not required to house the full range of tooling at any given time. This transportability provides us with the flexibility to optimize ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s capacity through centrally-coordinated production planning, which helps to adapt to shifting sales demand patterns while reducing the capital needed for tooling. With ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s large manufacturing footprint in place, we can support rapid seasonal growth in demand, focusing on customer service while minimizing transportation costs.

The standard fittings products (tees, wyes, elbows, etc.) that we produce and sell to connect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe on jobsites are blow molded or injection molded at fADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s domestic plants. In addition, customized fabricated fittings (e.g., more complex dual wall pipe reducers, bends or structures) are produced in 20 of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s North American plants. In addition to the extrusion of pipe, and blow molding and injection molding of fittings, we also use a variety of other processes in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing facilities. These processes include thermoforming, compression molding, and custom plastic welding and fabrication. The wide variety of production processes and expertise allow us to provide cost-effective finished goods at competitive prices delivered in a timely fashion to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing plants have no process-related by-products released into the atmosphere, waterways, or solid waste discharge. During pipe production start-ups and size change-overs, non-compliant scrap and any damaged finished goods pipe are recycled through a grinder for internal re-use.
International Presence - We serve international markets primarily through joint ventures with local partners. This joint venture strategy has provided us with local and regional access to markets such as Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Peru and Colombia. These international facilities produce pipe and related products to be sold in their respective regional markets. Combining a local partners customer relationships, brand recognition and local management talent, with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s world-class manufacturing and process expertise, broad product portfolio and innovation, creates a powerful platform and exciting opportunities for continued international expansion.
Quality Control - We have two internal quality control laboratory facilities equipped and staffed to evaluate and confirm incoming raw material and finished goods quality in addition to the quality testing that is done at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing facilities. We conduct annual safety, product and process quality audits at each of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s facilities, using centralized internal resources in combination with external third-party services. In the quality area, various national agencies such as National Transportation Product Evaluation Program (NTPEP), International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials (IAPMO), Bureau de normalisation du Qubec (BNQ), Intertek for Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Entidad Mexicana de Acreditacion A.C. (EMA) and NSF International and numerous state Departments of Transportation (DOT) and municipal authorities conduct both scheduled and unscheduled inspections of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s plants to verify product quality and compliance to applicable standards.
Training - Core to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s commitment and enablement of a safe and productive manufacturing environment are ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operational and management training programs.Through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ADS Academy, we deliver targeted role-specific training to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations team members through a blended curriculum of on-line and hands-on training experiences covering safety, quality, product knowledge and manufacturing process. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s learning management system, which hosts over 600 custom modules, serves as the foundation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operational training programs and provides us with appropriate scale, efficiency, and governance to support ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s growth. We have a strong commitment to the training of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing supervisors and managers in technical, management, and leadership subjects through intense role-based assimilation plans, e-learning and classroom-based development experiences.
Fleet - We also operate an in-house fleet of approximately 700 tractors. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s effective shipping radius is between approximately 300-350 miles from one of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing plants or distribution centers. The combination of a dedicated fleet and team of company drivers allows greater flexibility and responsiveness in meeting dynamic customer jobsite delivery expectations. We strive to achieve less than three-day lead-time on deliveries, and have the added benefit of redeploying fleet and driver assets to respond to short-term regional spikes in sales activity. For deliveries that are outside an economic delivery radius of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s truck fleet, common carrier deliveries are tendered using a customized software platform to ensure that lowest delivered freight costs are achieved. In addition, in the United States and Canada, approximately 12% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe volume is sold on a pick-up or walk-in basis at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s plant and yard locations, further leveraging ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s footprint and lowering freight cost per pound and per revenue dollar.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s North American truck fleet incorporates approximately 1,300 trailers that are specially designed to haul ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s lightweight pipe and fittings products. These designs maximize payload versus conventional over the road trailers and facilitate unassisted unloading of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products at the jobsites by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s drivers. The scope of fleet operations also includes backhaul of purchased raw materials providing a lower delivered cost to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s plant locations.

Pipe
Dual Wall Corrugated Pipe - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s N-12 pipe is a dual wall HDPE pipe with a corrugated exterior for strength and a smooth interior wall for hydraulics and flow capacity. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s N-12 pipe competes in the storm sewer and drainage markets that are also served by concrete pipe.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s N-12 pipe is available in 17 different diameters ranging from 2 to 60 and in sections ranging from 10 to 30 in length. N-12 provides joint integrity, with integral bell and spigot joints for fast push-together installation, and is sold either with watertight or soil-tight coupling and fitting systems.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s corrugated polyethylene pipe offers many benefits including ease of installation, job-site handling and resistance to corrosion and abrasion. Corrugated pipe can easily be cut or coupled together, providing precise laying lengths while minimizing installation waste and difficulty.
HP Storm Pipe and SaniTite HP Pipe - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s HP Storm pipe utilizes polypropylene resin, which provides (i)increased pipe stiffness relative to HDPE; (ii)higher Environmental Stress Crack Resistance (ESCR); and (iii)improved thermal properties, which improves joint performance. These improved physical characteristics result in a reduced need for select backfill, which creates installation savings for customers and expands the range of possible product applications.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s SaniTite HP pipe utilizes the same polypropylene resins as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s HP Storm pipe but includes a smooth third exterior wall in 30 to 60 pipe. The highly engineered polypropylene resin along with the triple wall design enables SaniTiteHP to surpass the 46 pounds per square inch (psi), stiffness requirement for sanitary sewer applications. SaniTiteHP offers cost and performance advantages relative to reinforced concrete pipe (such as improved hydraulics and better joint integrity) and PVC pipe (such as impact resistance).
Single Wall Corrugated Pipe - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s single wall corrugated HDPE pipe is ideal for drainage projects where flexibility, light weight and low cost are important. Single wall HDPE pipe products have been used for decades in agricultural drainage, highway edge drains, septic systems and other construction applications. In the agricultural market, improved technology has highlighted the favorable impact of drainage on crop yields. For homeowners, it is an economical and easily-installed solution for downspout run-off, foundation drains, driveway culverts and general lawn drainage. Single wall pipe is also used for golf courses, parks and athletic fields to keep surfaces dry by channeling away excess underground moisture.
Standard single wall products are available in 2 to 24 diameters and sold in varying lengths. Pipe with 2 to 6 diameters is typically sold in coils ranging from 25 to over 3,000 in length, while larger diameter pipe is 
6
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
typically sold in 20 lengths. Pipe can be either perforated or non-perforated depending on the particular drainage application.
Triple Wall Corrugated Pipe and Smoothwall HDPE Pipe - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ADS-3000 Triple Wall pipe, small diameter triple wall corrugated pipe, consists of a corrugated polyethylene core molded between a smooth white outer wall and a smooth black inner wall. This combination of the three wall design adds strength and stiffness, while reducing weight as compared to PVC 2729. Triple Wall is produced in two sizes, 3 and 4, and sold through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s distribution network. We also manufacture smoothwall HDPE pipe in 3, 4, and 6 diameters that are sold into the residential drainage and on-site septic systems markets.
High Performance Fiber Reinforced Polypropylene Pipe (HPXR 75) - In fiscal 2017, we introduced a new product, a corrugated polypropylene pipe is combined with a smooth outer wall that incorporates oriented glass fiber reinforcement, creating a pipe with increased stiffness and installation performance. The product will be available in diameters ranging from 30 to 60 inches, and 13 and 20 lengths.
Allied Products
We produce a range of additional water management products that are complementary to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe products (Allied Products). ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Products offer adjacent technologies to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s core pipe offering, presenting a complete drainage solution for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s clients and customers. This combination of pipe and Allied Products is a key strategy in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s sales growth, profitability and market share penetration. The practice of selling a drainage system is attractive to both distributors and end users, by providing a broad package of products that can be sold on individual projects, and strengthens ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitive advantage in the marketplace. We aggressively seek and evaluate new products, technologies and regulatory changes that impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers needs for Allied Products.
Using the strength of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall sales and distribution platform, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Product strategy allows us to more deeply penetrate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s end markets and anticipate the evolving needs of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers. The underground construction industry has historically been project (not product) driven, creating the impetus for owners, engineers and contractors to seek manufacturers that deliver solution-based product portfolios. Many of the components of underground construction are related and require linear compatibility of function, regulatory approval and technology.
Storm and Septic Chambers - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s StormTech chambers are used for stormwater retention, detention and first flush underground water storage on non-residential site development and public projects. These highly engineered chambers are injection molded from high density polyethylene and polypropylene resins into a proprietary design which provides strength, durability, and resistance to corrosion. The chambers allow for the efficient storage of stormwater volume, reducing the underground construction footprint and costs to the contractors, developers, and property owners. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s StormTech chambers offer great flexibility in design and layout of underground water storage systems. They are an attractive alternative to open ponds by reducing ongoing maintenance and liability and providing more useable land for development. Stormwater runoff is collected and stored in rows of chambers and gradually reenters the water system base, reducing erosion and protecting waterways. The chambers are open bottom, which allows for high density stacking in both storage and shipment. This freight-efficient feature drives favorable cost-competitiveness in serving long-distance export markets. These chamber systems typically incorporate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s other product lines such as corrugated pipe, fabricated fittings, water quality units and geotextiles.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ARC and BioDiffuser products are chambers that are used in on-site septic systems for residential and small volume non-residential wastewater treatment and disposal. Rural homes and communities that do not have access tocentral sewer lines require an on-site septic solution. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ARC and BioDiffuser chamber products are installed and perform their septic treatment function without gravel, reducing costs to the contractor and homeowner over traditional pipe and stone systems.States and municipalities have different sizing criteria for on-site septic treatment systems based on soil and site conditions. The innovative design of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ARC chamber is generally approved for a footprint reduction, further reducing the cost of the septic system. Injection-molded from high density polyethylene, these products are strong, durable, and chemical-resistant. These interconnecting chambers are favored by septic contractors because they are lightweight, easy to install and offer articulating features which increase site-specific design flexibility.

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS
Virgin HDPE and PP resins are derivatives of ethylene and propylene, respectively. Ethylene and propylene are derived from natural gas liquids or crude oil derivatives in the U.S. We currently purchase in excess of 850million pounds of virgin and recycled resin annually from over 480suppliers in North America. As a high-volume buyer of resin, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is able to achieve economies of scale to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s purchasing strategies differ based on the material (virgin resin v. recycled material) ordered for delivery to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s production locations. The price movements of the different materials also vary, resulting in the need to use a number of strategies to reduce volatility and successfully pass on cost increases to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customer through timely selling price increases when needed.
We have developed relationships with all of the North American producers of virgin high density polyethylene and impact copolymer polypropylene producers that manufacture the grades we need to produce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products, including Braskem Americas, Inc., Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. LP, The Dow Chemical Company, Equistar Chemicals, LP, ExxonMobil Chemical Company, Formosa Plastics Corporation, U.S.A., Ineos Olefins Polyolefins, USA, Sasol USA, and Nova Chemical. The North American capacity for ethylene derivatives is being expanded primarily as a result of the new supplies of natural gas liquids being produced through sustained oil and gas exploration and production. We anticipate that the previously announced projects for ethylene derivative capacity associated with HDPE will continue coming on stream during 2017, extending through 2018. The polypropylene capacity expansion projects to utilize the increased supply of propylene are projected to begin coming on-stream in 2018.

We leverage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s raw material blending and processing technologies to produce an HDPE pipe that incorporates recycled resin. This product, which meets an ASTM International standard, replaces a majority of the virgin resin that is used in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials product with optimized recycled materials. To further develop ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s recycled material strategies, we established Green Line Polymers, Inc. (GLP), as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s wholly-owned recycling subsidiary in 2012. GLP procures and processes recycled raw materials that can be used in products we produce and sell. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s first production facilities were established in Ohio and Georgia and are focused on processing post-industrial HDPE recycled materials. Based on the success of this strategy, we acquired a business that could supply clean, post-consumer recycled HDPE to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s upper Midwest plants and established a second post-consumer processing plant, in Pennsylvania, to support ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s plants in Ohio, Michigan and the eastern and southern United States. In fiscal 2017, 88% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s non-virgin HDPE raw material needs were internally processed (enhanced) through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s GLP operations.

Item1A.
Risk Factors
Please carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information included or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occur, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock could decline significantly.
Risks Relating to Restatements and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Financial Reporting Process
The restatements of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously issued financial statements and the related claims, investigations and proceedings arising out of the Prior Restatement have been time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that would adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
As described in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 (the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K), we restated ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March31, 2014 and 2013, as well as each of the first three quarters in fiscal 2015 and for all of the quarterly periods in fiscal 2014 (the Prior Restatement). We also restated ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial results for the fiscal years ended March31, 2012 and 2011, as summarized in Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Fiscal 2015 Form10-K. In addition, as described in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 (the Fiscal 2016 Form 10-K), we restated ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as well as each of the quarters in fiscal 2016 and 2015 (the Stock-Based Compensation Restatement). We also restated ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial results for the fiscal years ended March31, 2013 and 2012, as summarized in Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 (the Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K). Both the Prior Restatement and the Stock-Based Compensation Restatement were time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to a number of additional risks that would adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
In particular, we incurred significant expense, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees in connection with the Prior Restatement and the Stock-Based Compensation Restatement.Expenses incurred during fiscal 2017 and 2016 as a result of the Prior Restatement were approximately $24 million and $28million, respectively. We have also incurred significant expense in connection with the ongoing remediation of the weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting as further described below.
We have identified material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to report ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, investor confidence in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s company and, as a result, the value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is required to evaluate the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s disclosure controls on a periodic basis and publicly disclose the results of these evaluations and related matters in accordance with the requirements of Section404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As of March 31, 2017, we have identified certain material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the areas of (i)ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s control environment, (ii)accounting for leases, (iii) accounting for inventory, (iv)journal entry and account reconciliation, (v)ADS Mexicana control environment, and (vi)ADS Mexicana revenue recognition cut-off practices as described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. As a result of such material weaknesses, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management concluded that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March31, 2017.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is actively engaged in remediation activities designed to address these material weaknesses, but ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation efforts are not complete and are ongoing. Although ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is working to remedy the ineffectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation plan is fully implemented, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to report ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results in a timely and accurate manner, we may not be 
13
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
able to comply with the applicable covenants in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financing arrangements, and may be required to seek additional amendments or waivers under these financing arrangements, which could adversely impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s liquidity and financial condition. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s internal control over financial reporting could reduce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s managements time to comply with applicable requirements.
Any failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or material misstatement in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements. Any new misstatement could result in a further restatement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reporting obligations, reduce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reported financial information, leading to a decline in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock price. We cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting.
As a result of the material weaknesses, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March31, 2017. This could cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial statements and could result in a decrease in the value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. Failure to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 could potentially subject us to sanctions or investigations by the SEC, NYSE, or other regulatory authorities.
Further, we may be the subject of negative publicity focusing on the restatements of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously issued financial results and related matters, and may be adversely impacted by negative reactions from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders, creditors or others with which we do business. This negative publicity may impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to attract and retain customers, employees and vendors. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could harm ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business and reputation and cause the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s securities to decline.
Furthermore, as we grow ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s disclosure controls and internal controls will become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to ensure the effectiveness of these controls. If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to continue upgrading ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, additional management and other resources may need to be devoted to assist in compliance with the disclosure and financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial position and results of operations.
The ongoing remediation of the material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting will require us to continue to incur significant cost and expense and may require additional management time and attention, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
We continue to incur significant costs and expenses related to the ongoing remediation of the weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps, including both adding internal personnel and hiring outside consultants, and intend to continue to take appropriate and reasonable steps to strengthen ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s accounting function and reduce the risk of any future misstatements in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial statements. For more details about the status of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation plan, see Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K. To the extent these steps are not successful, we may have to incur additional time and expense, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position and cash flows. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s managements attention has also been, and may further be, diverted from the operation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business in connection with the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal controls, which efforts could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations.
The Prior Restatement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously issued financial results has resulted in private litigation as well as an ongoing investigation by the SEC, and could result in additional litigation, government investigations and enforcement actions that could have a material adverse impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.
We have been subject to a securities class action litigation suit that was originally filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as a result of the Prior Restatement. Although the District Court has dismissed all of the plaintiffs claims, the plaintiff has appealed the dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. It is possible that the Court of Appeals could reverse the District Courts decision 
14

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
and remand for further proceedings. The ongoing remediation of the material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting will require us to continue to incur significant cost and expense and may require additional management time and attention, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has received document subpoenas from the SECs Division of Enforcement pursuant to a formal investigation. Both the securities class action litigation suit and SEC investigation are further described below under Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We could also become subject to additional litigation or government investigations and enforcement actions arising out of the Prior Restatement, the Stock-Based Compensation Restatement, as well as delinquent Exchange Act filings.
To date ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management has devoted significant time and attention related to these matters, and we may be required to devote even more time and attention to such matters in the future, and these and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. While we cannot estimate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already incurred significant amounts investigating the claims underlying the class action litigation and SEC document production and expect to continue to need to expend significant amounts to defend such litigation and respond to the SEC investigation. Although we maintain insurance that may provide coverage for some or all of these expenses, and we have given notice to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s insurers of the claims, there is risk that the insurers will rescind or otherwise not renew the policies, that some or all of the claims will not be covered by such policies, or that, even if covered, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ultimate liability will exceed the available insurance. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Fiscal 2017 Form 10-K.
Risks Relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Business
Fluctuations in the price and availability of resins, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s principal raw materials, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inability to obtain adequate supplies of resins from suppliers and pass on resin price increases to customers could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The principal raw materials that we use in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and Allied Products are virgin and recycled resins. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to operate profitably depends, to a large extent, on the markets for these resins. In particular, as resins are derived either directly or indirectly from crude oil derivatives and natural gas liquids, resin prices fluctuate substantially as a result of changes in crude oil and natural gas prices, changes in existing processing capabilities and the capacity of resin suppliers. The petrochemical industry historically has been cyclical and volatile. The cycles are generally characterized by periods of tight supply, followed by periods of oversupply, primarily resulting from significant capacity additions. For example, resin prices have increased since 2010 due to increased demand in the broader economy. Unanticipated changes in and disruptions to existing petrochemical capacities could also significantly increase resin prices, often within a short period of time, even if crude oil and natural gas prices remain low.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to offer ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s core products depends on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to obtain adequate resins, which we purchase directly from major petrochemical and chemical suppliers. We have managed a formal resin price risk management program since early in 2010 that entails both physical fixed price and volume contracts, and in previous periods, financial hedges which are designed to apply to a significant portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s annual virgin resin purchases. In conjunction with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s resin price risk management program, we maintain supply agreements with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s major resin suppliers that provide multi-year terms and volumes that are in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s projected consumption. For ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s polypropylene virgin resin price exposure, we utilize financial hedges of propylene as a proxy for polypropylene. Historically, the month to month change in market based pricing has been very similar between propylene and polypropylene. The loss of, or substantial decrease in the availability of, raw materials from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s suppliers, or the failure by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s suppliers to continue to provide us with raw materials on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, supply interruptions could arise from labor disputes or weather conditions affecting supplies or shipments, transportation disruptions or other factors beyond ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control. An extended disruption in the timely availability of raw materials from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s key suppliers would result in a decrease in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s revenues and profitability.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to maintain profitability heavily depends on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to pass through to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers the full amount of any increase in raw material costs, which are a large portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall product costs. We may be 
15
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
unable to do so in a timely manner, or at all, due to competition in the markets in which we operate. In addition, certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s largest customers historically have exerted significant pressure on their outside suppliers to keep prices low because of their market share. If increases in the cost of raw materials cannot be passed on to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, or the duration of time associated with a pass through becomes extended, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be adversely affected.
Any disruption or volatility in general business and economic conditions in the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on the demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and services.
The markets in which we operate are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the UnitedStates and worldwide, including availability of credit, interest rates, fluctuation in capital and business and consumer confidence. The capital and credit markets have in recent years been experiencing significant volatility and disruption. These conditions, combined with price fluctuations in crude oil derivatives and natural gas liquids, declining business and consumer confidence and increased unemployment, precipitated an economic slowdown and severe recession in recent years. The difficult conditions in these markets and the overall economy affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business in a number of ways. For example:
The slowdown and volatility of the United States economy in general is having an adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s sales that are dependent on the non-residential construction market.Continued uncertainty about current economic conditions will continue to pose a risk to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units that serve the non-residential construction market, as participants in this industry may postpone spending in response to tighter credit, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a continued material adverse effect on the demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and services.
The homebuilding industry underwent a significant decline from its peak in 2005. While new housing starts demonstrated an annual growth rate of 13.6% from 2010 to 2015, current levels remain substantially below the long-term average of 1.5million starts since the U.S. Census Bureau began reporting the data in 1959. The mortgage markets continue to experience disruption and reduced availability of mortgages for potential homebuyers due to more restrictive standards to qualify for mortgages, including with respect to new home construction loans. The multi-year downturn in the homebuilding industry resulted in a substantial reduction in demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and services in this market, which in turn had a significant adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations during the period from 2008 to 2014, as compared to peak levels.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business depends to a great extent upon general activity levels in the agriculture market. Changes in corn production, soybean production, farm income, farmland value and the level of farm output in the geographic locations in which we operate are all material factors that could adversely affect the agriculture market and result in a decrease in the amount of products that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers purchase. The nature of the agriculture market is such that a downturn in demand can occur suddenly, resulting in excess inventories, un-utilized production capacity and reduced prices for pipe products. These downturns may be prolonged and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s revenue and profitability would be harmed.
Demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and services depend to a significant degree on spending on infrastructure, which is inherently cyclical. Infrastructure spending is affected by a variety of factors beyond ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control, including interest rates, availability and commitment of public funds for municipal spending and highway spending and general economic conditions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products sales may be adversely impacted by budget cuts by governments, including as a result of lower than anticipated tax revenues.
All of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s markets are sensitive to changes in the broader economy. Downturns or lack of substantial improvement in the economy in any region in which we operate have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition and results of operations. While we operate in many markets, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business is particularly impacted by changes in the economies of the United States, Canada and Mexico, which represented approximately 87.7%, 7.4% and 3.8%, respectively, of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales for fiscal 2017 and collectively represented approximately 98.9% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales for fiscal 2017.
We cannot predict the duration of current economic conditions, or the timing or strength of any future recovery of activities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s markets. Continued weakness in the market in which we operate could have a material 
16
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may have to close under-performing facilities from time to time as warranted by general economic conditions and/or weakness in the markets in which we operate. In addition to a reduction in demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products, these factors may also reduce the price ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is able to charge for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and restrict ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to pass raw material cost increases to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers. This, combined with an increase in excess capacity, will negatively impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s profitability, cash flows and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition, generally.
Demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and services could decrease if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to compete effectively, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s success depends largely on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to convert current demand for competitive products into demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products.
We compete with both manufacturers of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and manufacturers of alternative products, such as concrete, steel and PVC pipe products, on the basis of a number of considerations, including product characteristics such as durability, design, ease of installation, price on a price-to-value basis and service. In particular, we compete on a global, national and local basis with pipe products made of traditional materials which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe products are designed to replace. For example, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s N-12 and SaniTite HP products face competition from concrete, steel and PVC pipe products in the small- and large-diameter size segments of the market.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to successfully compete and grow depends largely on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to continue to convert the current demand for concrete, steel and PVC pipe products into demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and Allied Products. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s thermoplastic pipe typically has an installed cost advantage of approximately 20% over concrete pipe. However, depending upon certain factors such as the size of the pipe, the geography of a particular location and then-existing raw material costs, the initial cost of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s thermoplastic pipe may be higher than the initial cost of alternative products such as concrete, steel and PVC pipe products. To increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s market share, we will need to increase material conversion by educating ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers about the value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products in comparison to existing alternatives, particularly on an installed cost basis, working with government agencies to expand approvals for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products and working with civil engineering firms which may influence the specification of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products on construction projects. No assurance can be given that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s efforts to increase or maintain the current rate of material conversion will be successful, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We also expect that new competitors may develop over time. No assurance can be given that we will be able to respond effectively to such competitive pressures. Increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in sales, prices, volumes and gross margins that would materially adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s success will depend, in part, on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to maintain ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s market share and gain market share from competitors.
Certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors have financial and other resources that are greater than ours and may be better able to withstand price competition, especially with respect to traditional products. In addition, consolidation by industry participants could result in competitors with increased market share, larger customer bases, greater diversified product offerings and greater technological and marketing expertise, which would allow them to compete more effectively against us. Moreover, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors may develop products that are superior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Technological advances by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors may lead to new manufacturing techniques and make it more difficult for us to compete. In many markets in which we operate there are no significant entry barriers that would prevent new competitors from entering the market, especially on the local level, or existing competitors from expanding in the market. In addition, because we do not have long-term arrangements with many of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, these competitive factors could cause ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers to cease purchasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products.
In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s contracts with municipalities are often awarded and renewed through periodic competitive bidding. We may not be successful in obtaining or renewing these contracts on financially attractive terms or at all, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations could be adversely affected by the effects of weather.
Although weather patterns affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating results throughout the year, adverse weather historically has reduced construction activity in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s third and fourth fiscal quarters. In contrast, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s highest volume of net sales historically has occurred in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s first and second fiscal quarters.
Most of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units experience seasonal variation as a result of the dependence of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers on suitable weather to engage in construction projects. Generally, during the winter months, construction activity declines due to inclement weather, frozen ground and shorter daylight hours. For example, during the spring of 2013 and 2014, the extremely cold weather significantly reduced the level of construction activities in the UnitedStates, thereby impacting ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s revenues. In addition, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, floods, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the geographic regions in which we operate, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations may be adversely affected. For example, Hurricane Andrew in Florida in 1992 and the extensive flooding of the Mississippi River in 2011 resulted in temporary interruption in business activity in these areas. We anticipate that fluctuations of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations results from period to period due to seasonality will continue in the future.
The loss of any of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s significant customers could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s 10 largest customers generated approximately 37.4% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales in fiscal 2017. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historical levels. Because we do not have long-term arrangements with many of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, such customers may cease purchasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products without notice or upon short notice to us. During the economic downturn, some of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers reduced their operations. For example, some homebuilder customers exited or severely curtailed building activity in certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s markets. There is no assurance that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers will increase their activity level or return it to historic levels. A slow economic recovery could continue to have material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In addition, consolidation among customers could also result in a loss of some of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s present customers to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors. The loss of one or more of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s significant customers, a significant customers decision to purchase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, or deterioration in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s relationship with any of them could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
The majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales are credit sales which are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry and geographic areas in which they operate, and the failure to collect monies owed from customers could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition.
The majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales volume is facilitated through the extension of credit to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry in the areas where they operate. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units offer credit to customers, either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer, or secured credit for materials sold for a specific job where the security lies in lien rights associated with the material going into the job. The type of credit offered depends both on the financial strength of the customer and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved. End users, resellers and other non-contractor customers generally purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit. The inability of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers to pay off their credit lines in a timely manner, or at all, would adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s collections efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers could negatively impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customer relations going forward.
Because we depend on the creditworthiness of certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, if the financial condition of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers declines, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s credit risk could increase. Significant contraction in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s markets, coupled with tightened credit availability and financial institution underwriting standards, could adversely affect certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers. Should one or more of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s larger customers declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s accounts receivable, bad debt reserves and net income.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s international operations expose us to political, economic and regulatory risks not normally faced by businesses that operate only in the United States.
International operations are exposed to different political, economic and regulatory risks that are not faced by businesses that operate solely in the United States.Some of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations are outside the United States, with manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada and several Latin American countries. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s international operations are subject to risks similar to those affecting ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations in the United States in addition to a number of other risks, including: difficulties in enforcing contractual and intellectual property rights; impositions or increases of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries and affiliates; exposure to different legal standards; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; impositions or increases of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments; the requirements of a wide variety of foreign laws; political and economic instability; war; and difficulties in staffing and managing operations, particularly in remote locations.
As a result of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s international operations, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to wrongfully influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining an unfair advantage, and generally require companies to maintain accurate books and records and internal controls, including at foreign controlled subsidiaries. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws, with more frequent voluntary self-disclosures by companies, aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC resulting in record fines and penalties, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals.
We have operations in Canada as well as existing joint ventures in Mexico and South America. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal policies provide for compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws for both us and for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint venture operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of such violations in the future. Despite ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s training and compliance programs, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from unauthorized, reckless or criminal acts committed by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees, agents or joint venture partners.
Furthermore, as part of the Prior Restatement, managementidentified certain weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s internal control over financial reporting, which weaknesses included certain control deficiencies related to the ADS Mexicana control environment, as well as the ADS Mexicana revenue recognition cut-off practices. These material weaknesses are further described in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures, below.Certain of the matters related to the ADS Mexicana control environment were already the subject of investigation by third party advisors to the Audit Committee as part of the restatement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously issued financial statements as set forth in the Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. Although such matters have resulted in a determination of material weakness, neither the Audit Committees advisors in the course of their investigation nor management concluded whether the weaknesses in the ADS Mexicana control environment, the ADS Mexicana revenue recognition cut-off practices, or any other material weaknesses of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. as described in Item 9A, would result in an ultimate determination by the SEC or any other applicable regulatory agency that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not complied with the books and records and internal control provisions of the FCPA as set forth in sections 13(b)(2)(A) and 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act. In the event that we believe or have reason to believe that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees, agents or joint venture partners have or may have violated applicable anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, we may be required to investigate or have outside counsel investigate the relevant facts and circumstances, which can be expensive and require significant time and attention from senior management. A finding that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. or its affiliates have violated any of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could disrupt ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business and result in a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
Conducting a portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations through joint ventures exposes us to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control, and such risks could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
With respect to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s existing joint ventures in Mexico, North America and South America, any differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default or bankruptcy of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint venture partners. As a result, we may be unable to control the quality of products produced by the joint ventures or achieve consistency of product quality as compared with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s other operations. In addition to net sales and market share, this may have a material negative impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s brand and how it is perceived thereafter. Moreover, if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s partners also fail to invest in the joint venture in the manner that is anticipated or otherwise fail to meet their contractual obligations, the joint ventures may be unable to adequately perform and conduct their respective operations, requiring us to make additional investments or perform additional services to ensure the adequate performance and delivery of products and/or services to the joint ventures customers, which could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We may not be able to successfully expand into new product or geographic markets, which could negatively impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future sales and results of operations.
We may expand into new product markets based on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s existing manufacturing, design and engineering capabilities and services. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business depends in part on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to identify future products and product lines that complement existing products and product lines and that respond to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers needs. We may not be able to compete effectively unless ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s product selection keeps up with trends in the markets in which we compete or trends in new products. In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to integrate new products and product lines into ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s distribution network could impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to compete. Furthermore, the success of new products and new product lines will depend on market demand and there is a risk that new products and new product lines will not deliver expected results, which could negatively impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future sales and results of operations.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s expansion into new geographic markets may present competitive, distribution and regulatory challenges that differ from current ones. We may be less familiar with the target customers and may face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to existing operations. Expansion into new geographic markets may also bring us into direct competition with companies with whom we have little or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we rely upon expansion into new geographic markets for growth and do not meet the new challenges posed by such expansion, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future sales growth could be negatively impacted, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating costs could increase, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business operations and financial results could be adversely affected.
We may not achieve the acquisition component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s growth strategy, which could negatively impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations.
Acquisitions may continue to be an important component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s growth strategy; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to grow ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business through acquisitions as we have done historically or that any businesses acquired will perform in accordance with expectations or that business judgments concerning the value, strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove to be correct. Future acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in interest expense and amortization expense and significant charges relative to integration costs. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s strategy could be impeded if we do not identify suitable acquisition candidates and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to properly evaluate acquisition targets.
Acquisitions involve a number of special risks, including: problems implementing disclosure controls and procedures for the newly acquired business; unforeseen difficulties extending internal control over financial reporting and performing the required assessment at the newly acquired business; potential adverse short-term effects on operating results through increased costs or otherwise; diversion of managements attention and failure to recruit new, and retain existing, key personnel of the acquired business; failure to successfully implement infrastructure, logistics and systems integration; ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business growth could outpace the capability of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s systems; and the risks inherent in the systems of the acquired business and risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition and results of 
20

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
operations. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing necessary to complete acquisitions on attractive terms or at all.
Increased fuel and energy prices, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inability to obtain sufficient quantities of fuel to operate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s in-house delivery fleet, could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Energy and petroleum prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Prices and availability of petroleum products are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control. Political events in petroleum-producing regions as well as hurricanes and other weather-related events may cause the price of fuel to increase.
We consume a large amount of energy and petroleum products in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations, including the manufacturing process and delivering a significant volume of products to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s in-house fleet. While we utilize a diesel hedging program associated with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s in-house fleet to mitigate against higher fuel prices, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating profit will be adversely affected if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to obtain the energy and fuel we require or to fully offset the anticipated impact of higher energy and fuel prices through increased prices or surcharges to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers or through other hedging strategies. If shortages occur in the supply of energy or necessary petroleum products and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not able to pass along the full impact of increased energy or petroleum prices to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.
We have substantial fixed costs and, as a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s income from operations is sensitive to changes in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales.
A significant portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s expenses are fixed costs (including personnel). For fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, domestic fixed costs were 32.1%, 28.7% and 25.5%, respectively, as a percentage of domestic net sales. Consequently, a percentage decline in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales could have a greater percentage effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s income from operations if we do not act to reduce personnel or take other cost reduction actions. Moreover, a key element of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s strategy is managing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s assets, including ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s substantial fixed assets, more effectively, including through sales or other disposals of excess assets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s failure to rationalize ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s fixed assets in the time, and within the costs, we expect could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Internally manufacturing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s own facilities subjects ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business to risks associated with manufacturing processes.
We internally manufacture ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s own products at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s facilities. While we maintain insurance covering ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing and production facilities and have significant flexibility to manufacture and ship ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s own products from various facilities, a catastrophic loss of the use of certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, labor issues, weather conditions, other natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Unexpected failures of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s equipment and machinery may result in production delays, revenue loss and significant repair costs, injuries to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees, and customer claims.Any interruption in production capability may limit ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to supply enough products to customers and may require us to make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s profitability and cash flows. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to offset the lost revenues or increased costs that we may experience during a disruption of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations.
We provide product warranties that could expose us to claims, which could in turn damage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reputation and adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
We generally provide limited product warranties on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products against defects in materials and workmanship in normal use and service. Most of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe products have a warranty that is not limited in duration. The warranty period for other products such as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s StormTech chambers, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Inserta Tee product line, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver product line and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s FleXstorm inlet protection systems is generally one year. Estimating the required warranty reserves requires a high level of judgment. Management estimates warranty reserves, based in part upon historical warranty costs, as a proportion of sales by product line. Management also considers various relevant factors, 
21
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
including its stated warranty policies and procedures, as part of its evaluation of its liability. Because warranty issues may surface later in the product life cycle, management continues to review these estimates on a regular basis and considers adjustments to these estimates based on actual experience compared to historical estimates. Although management believes that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s warranty reserves as of March31, 2017 are adequate, actual results may vary from these estimates.
The nature of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business exposes us to construction defect and product liability claims as well as other legal proceedings, which could damage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reputation and adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is exposed to construction defect and product liability claims relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s various products if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products do not meet customer expectations. Such liabilities may arise out of the quality of raw materials we purchase from third-party suppliers, over which we do not have direct control. We also operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles and therefore face the risk of traffic accidents.
While we currently maintain insurance coverage to address a portion of these types of liabilities, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.Further, while we intend to seek indemnification against potential liability for products liability claims from relevant parties, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to recover under any such indemnification agreements. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant time periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful product liability defense could be highly costly and accordingly result in a decline in revenues and profitability. In addition, even if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute, claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in us and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products.
From time to time, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is also involved in government inquiries and investigations, as well as consumer, employment, tort proceedings and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, including potential environmental remediation and other proceedings commenced by government authorities. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take actions which would adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations or could require us to pay substantial amounts of money. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of managements attention and resources from other matters.
Because ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business is working capital intensive, we rely on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to manage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s supply purchasing and customer credit policies.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations are working capital intensive, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inventories, accounts receivable and accounts payable are significant components of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net asset base. We manage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inventories and accounts payable through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s purchasing policies and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s accounts receivable through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customer credit policies. If we fail to adequately manage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s supply purchasing or customer credit policies, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s working capital and financial condition may be adversely affected.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations are affected by various laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s failure to obtain or maintain approvals by municipalities, state departments of transportation, engineers and developers may affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations are principally affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in the United States, Canada and Latin America. While ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not engaged in a regulated industry, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting land usage, zoning, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices (including pensions), competition, immigration and other matters. Additionally, approvals by municipalities, the U.S. and state departments of transportation, engineers and developers may affect the products ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers are allowed to use, and, consequently, failure to obtain or maintain such approvals may affect the saleability of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products. Building codes may also affect the products ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers are allowed to use, and, consequently, changes in building codes may also affect the saleability of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products. Changes in applicable regulations governing the sale of some of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products could increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s costs of doing business. In addition, changes to applicable tax laws and regulations could increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s costs of doing business. We cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements.

We deliver products to many of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s own fleet of vehicles. The U.S. DOT regulates ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations in domestic interstate commerce. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is subject to safety requirements governing interstate operations prescribed by the U.S. DOT. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also remain subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service could increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s costs, which, if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to pass these cost increases on to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, would reduce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s gross margins and net income (loss) and increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s selling, general and administrative expenses.
We cannot predict whether future developments in law and regulations concerning ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units will affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition and results of operations in a negative manner. Similarly, we cannot assess whether ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units will be successful in meeting future demands of regulatory agencies in a manner which will not materially adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Interruptions in the proper functioning of information technology systems could disrupt operations and cause unanticipated increases in costs, decreases in revenues, or both. The implementation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s technology initiatives could disrupt ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations in the near term, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s technology initiatives might not provide the anticipated benefits or might fail.
Because we use ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s information technology (IT) systems to, among other things, manage inventories and accounts receivable, make purchasing decisions and monitor ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations, the proper functioning of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s IT systems is important to the successful operation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business. Although ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s IT systems are protected through physical and software safeguards and remote processing capabilities exist, IT systems are still vulnerable to natural disasters, power losses, unauthorized access, telecommunication failures and other problems.If critical IT systems fail, or are otherwise unavailable, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to process orders, track credit risk, identify business opportunities, maintain proper levels of inventories, collect accounts receivable and pay expenses and otherwise manage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units would be adversely affected.
Management uses IT systems to support decision making and to monitor business performance. We may fail to generate accurate financial and operational reports essential for making decisions at various levels of management. Failure to adopt systematic procedures to maintain quality IT general controls could disrupt ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate controls such as reconciliations, segregation of duties and verification to prevent errors or incomplete information, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to operate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business could be limited.
Third-party service providers are responsible for managing a significant portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s IT systems.ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third-party service provider does not perform satisfactorily. Additionally, there is no guarantee that we will continue to have access to these third-party IT systems after ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s current license agreements expire, and, if we do not obtain licenses to use effective replacement IT systems, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.
We have made, and will continue to make, significant technology investments in each of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units and in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s administrative functions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s technology initiatives are designed to streamline ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations to allow ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s associates to continue to provide high quality service to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers and to provide ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers a better experience, while improving the quality of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control environment. The cost and potential problems and interruptions associated with the implementation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s technology initiatives could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations in the near term. In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s new or upgraded technology might not provide the anticipated benefits, it might take longer than expected to realize the anticipated benefits or the technology might fail altogether.
We may experience a failure in or breach of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operational or information security systems, or those of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches.
Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks. A failure in or breach of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operational or information security systems, or those of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches could disrupt ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reputation, increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s costs and/or cause losses. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional significant resources to continue to

enhance ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.
If we become subject to material liabilities under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s self-insured programs, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial results may be adversely affected. We may see increased costs arising from health care reform.
We provide workers compensation, automobile and product/general liability coverage through a high deductible insurance program. In addition, we provide medical coverage to some of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees through a self-insured preferred provider organization. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if the number and severity of insurance claims increases.
In March 2010, the United States government enacted comprehensive health care reform legislation which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded and imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits. The legislation imposes implementation effective dates which began in 2010 and extend through 2020, and many of the changes require additional guidance from government agencies or federal regulations. Therefore, due to the phased-in nature of the implementation and the lack of interpretive guidance, it is difficult to determine at this time what impact the health care reform legislation will have on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial results. Possible adverse effects of the health care reform legislation include increased costs, exposure to expanded liability and requirements for us to revise ways in which we provide healthcare and other benefits to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s success depends upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to control labor costs and to attract, train and retain highly-qualified employees and key personnel.
To be successful, we must attract, train and retain a large number of highly qualified employees while controlling related labor costs. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wage rates and health and other insurance costs. We compete with other businesses for these employees and invest significant resources in training and motivating them. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain highly-qualified employees in the future, including, in particular, those employed by companies we acquire. None of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s domestic employees are currently covered by collective bargaining or other similar labor agreements. However, if a number of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees were to unionize, including in the wake of any future legislation that makes it easier for employees to unionize, the effect on us may be negative. Any inability by us to negotiate acceptable new contracts under any collective bargaining arrangements could cause strikes or other work stoppages, and new contracts could result in increased operating costs. If any such strikes or other work stoppages occur, or if employees become represented by a union, we could experience a disruption of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations and higher labor costs. Labor relations matters affecting ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s suppliers of products and services could also adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business from time to time.
In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business results of operations depend largely upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s chief executive officer and senior management team as well as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s plant managers and sales personnel, including those of companies recently acquired, and their experience, knowledge of local market dynamics and specifications and long-standing customer relationships. We customarily sign executive responsibility agreements with certain key personnel who are granted restricted stock or stock options under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employee incentive compensation programs, which contain confidentiality and non-competition provisions. However, in certain jurisdictions, non-competition provisionsmay not beenforceableor may not beenforceableto their full extent. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inability to retain or hire qualified plant managers or sales personnel at economically reasonable compensation levels would restrict ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to grow ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, limit ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to continue to successfully operate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business and result in lower operating results and profitability.
If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to protect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intellectual property rights, or we infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to compete could be negatively impacted.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to protect and preserve proprietary aspects of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intellectual property, which we attempt to do, both in the United States and in foreign countries, through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party 
24

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other laws concerning proprietary rights, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intellectual property rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, results of operations and financial condition.
We have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products, processes and services. While we generally apply for patents in those countries where we primarily intend to make, have made, use, or sell patented products, we may not accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure that any of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s patent applications will be approved. We also cannot assure that the patents issuing as a result of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s foreign patent applications will have the same scope of coverage as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s United States patents. The patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. Further, we cannot assure that competitors will not infringe ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s patents, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s patents.
We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise obtain access to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s unpatented technology. To protect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trade secrets and other proprietary information, we generally require applicable employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements. We cannot assure that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to maintain the proprietary nature of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s technologies, we could be materially adversely affected.
We rely on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products from the products of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademark applications or otherwise challenge ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s use of the trademarks. In the event that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure that competitors will not infringe ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks or that we will have adequate resources to enforce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks. We also license third parties to use certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks. In an effort to preserve ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademark rights, we enter into license agreements with these third parties which govern the use of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks and which require ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s licensees to abide by quality control standards with respect to the goods and services that they provide under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks. Although we make efforts to police the use of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademarks by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s licensees, we cannot assure that these efforts will be sufficient to ensure that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s licensees abide by the terms of their licenses. In the event that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s licensees fail to do so, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s trademark rights could be diluted.
Although we rely on copyright laws to protect the works of authorship (including software) created by us, we generally do not register the copyrights in any of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s copyrightable works. Copyrights of United States origin must be registered before the copyright owner may bring an infringement suit in the United States. Furthermore, if a copyright of United States origin is not registered within three months of publication of the underlying work, the copyright owner is precluded from seeking statutory damages or attorneys fees in any United States enforcement action and is limited to seeking actual damages and lost profits. Accordingly, if one of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s unregistered copyrights of United States origin is infringed by a third party, we will need to register the copyright before we can file an infringement suit in the United States, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remedies in any such infringement suit may be limited.
The misuse of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intellectual property rights by others could adversely impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to compete, cause ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales to decrease or otherwise harm ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail.
Also, we cannot be certain that the products that we sell do not and will not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others. Further, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, including claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
rights of third parties by us or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, whom we generally indemnify in connection with their use of the products that we manufacture. These claims could divert managements attention and resources and may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of ourselves or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, regardless of the merits of the claims.Should we be found liable for infringement, we may be required to enter into licensing agreements (if available on acceptable terms or at all) or pay damages and cease making or selling certain products. Moreover, we may need to redesign or sell different products to avoid future infringement liability. Any of the foregoing could cause us to incur significant costs, prevent us from selling ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products or negatively impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to compete.
We could incur significant costs in complying with environmental, health and safety laws or permits or as a result of satisfying any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or permits.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes, protect the health and safety of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees and the end users of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products, regulate the materials used in and the recycling of products and impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances. Violations of these laws and regulations, failure to obtain or maintain required environmental permits or non-compliance with any conditions contained in any environmental permit can result in substantial fines or penalties, injunctive relief, requirements to install pollution or other controls or equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations and/or facility shutdowns. We could be held liable for the costs to address contamination of any real property we have ever owned, leased, operated or used, including as a disposal site. We could also incur fines, penalties, sanctions or be subject to third-party claims for property damage, personal injury or nuisance or otherwise as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws in connection with releases of hazardous or other materials.
In addition, changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, including additional investigation or other obligations with respect to any potential health hazards of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products or business activities or the imposition of new permit requirements, may lead to additional compliance or other costs that could have material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
A change in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s product mix could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results may be affected by a change in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s product mix on which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s gross margin depends. Changes in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s product mix may result from marketing activities to existing customers and needs communicated to us from existing and prospective customers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s outlook, budgeting and strategic planning assume a certain product mix of sales. If actual results vary from this projected product mix of sales, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial results could be negatively impacted.
We may be affected by global climate change or by legal, regulatory or market responses to such potential change.
Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant federal, state, and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For example, in the past several years, the U.S. Congress has considered various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. While these bills have not yet received sufficient Congressional support for enactment, some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency, spurred by judicial interpretation of the Clean Air Act, may regulate GHG emissions, especially diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us. These costs include an increase in the cost of the fuel and other energy we purchase and capital costs associated with updating or replacing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal fleet of trucks and other vehicles prematurely. In addition, new laws or future regulation could directly and indirectly affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers and suppliers (through an increase in the cost of production or their ability to produce satisfactory products) and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business (through the impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inventory availability, cost of sales, operations or demands for the products we sell). Until the timing, scope and extent of any future regulation becomes known, we cannot predict its effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cost structure or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating results. Notwithstanding ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s dedication to being a responsible corporate citizen, it is reasonably possible that such legislation or regulation could impose material costs on us.

Anti-terrorism measures and other disruptions to the raw material supply network could impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to provide efficient distribution of products to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers is an integral component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall business strategy. In the aftermath of terrorist attacks in the United States, federal, state and local authorities have implemented and continue to implement various security measures that affect the raw material supply network in the United States and abroad. If security measures disrupt or impede the receipt of sufficient raw materials, we may fail to meet the needs of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers or may incur increased expenses to do so.
Risks Relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Indebtedness
We have substantial debt and may incur substantial additional debt, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial health, reduce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s profitability, limit ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to obtain financing in the future and pursue certain business opportunities and reduce the value of yADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment.
As of March31, 2017, we had an aggregate principal amount of $350.4million of outstanding debt. In fiscal year 2017, we incurred $13.6million of interest expense related to this debt.
The amount of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt or such other obligations could have important consequences for holders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock, including, but not limited to: a substantial portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for other purposes; ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements or general corporate purposes and other purposes may be impaired in the future; ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s borrowings is at variable rates of interest; we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors with less debt or with comparable debt at more favorable interest rates and that, as a result, may be better positioned to withstand economic downturns; ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to refinance indebtedness may be limited or the associated costs may increase; ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to engage in acquisitions without raising additional equity or obtaining additional debt financing may be impaired in the future; it may be more difficult for us to satisfy ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s obligations to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s creditors, resulting in possible defaults on and acceleration of such indebtedness; we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to withstand competitive pressures could be limited, or we may be prevented from making capital investments that are necessary or important to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations in general, growth strategy and efforts to improve operating margins of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business units.
If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional equity capital or refinance ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In the future, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cash flow and capital resources may not be sufficient for payments of interest on and principal of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt, and such alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s scheduled debt service obligations.
We cannot make assurances that we will be able to refinance any of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s indebtedness, or obtain additional financing, particularly because of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s high levels of debt and the debt incurrence restrictions imposed by the agreements governing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt, as well as prevailing market conditions. We could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt service and other obligations. Subject to certain exceptions, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Secured Bank Term Loans and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Senior Notes, which we have defined in Note 12. Debt to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, restrict ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to dispose of assets and how we use the proceeds from any such dispositions. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to consummate those dispositions, or if we do, what the timing of the dispositions will be or whether the proceeds that we realize will be adequate to meet ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt service obligations, when due.
Despite ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition described above.
We may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the agreements governing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
constitute indebtedness, including obligations under lease arrangements that are currently recorded as operating leases. In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Revolving Credit Facility provides an aggregate commitment of up to $325.0million. As of March31, 2017, we had an additional $120.1million of availability under the Revolving Credit Facility. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s subsidiary ADS Mexicana had $10.5million in availability outstanding under a separate revolving credit facility. If new debt is added to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify. See Note 12. Debt to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The agreements and instruments governing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to operate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business and adversely affect the holders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
The covenants contained in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Secured Bank Term Loans and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Senior Notes, which we refer to collectively as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Credit Facilities, are consistent. These covenants, among other things, restrict or limit ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to: dispose of assets; incur additional indebtedness (including guarantees of additional indebtedness); prepay or amend ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s various debt instruments; pay dividends and make certain payments; redeem stock or make other distributions; create liens on assets; make certain investments; engage in certain asset sales, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations or sales of all, or substantially all, of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s assets; and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in the Credit Facilities may be affected by economic, financial and industry conditions beyond ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control. The breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the Credit Facilities that would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders, as the case may be, to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is unable to repay indebtedness, secured parties having secured obligations, such as the lenders under the Credit Facilities, could proceed against the collateral securing the secured obligations. This could have serious consequences to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations and could cause us to become bankrupt or insolvent.
We may have future capital needs and may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms.
Although we believe that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s current cash position and the additional committed funding available under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Credit Facilities is sufficient for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s current operations, any reductions in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s available borrowing capacity, or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s inability to renew or replace ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt facilities, when required or when business conditions warrant, could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition and results of operations. The economic conditions, credit market conditions, and economic climate affecting ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry, as well as other factors, may constrain ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financing abilities. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to secure additional financing, if available, and to satisfy ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future operating performance, the availability of credit generally, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control. The market conditions and the macroeconomic conditions that affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.
If financing is not available when needed, or is available on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, financial condition and results of operations. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity, convertible debt securities or other securities convertible into equity, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution in their percentage ownership, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
We may not be able to satisfy ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s outstanding obligations upon a change of control.
Under the Secured Bank Term Loans, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the lenders to accelerate the maturity of borrowings under the agreement and terminate their commitments to lend. Additionally, under the Senior Notes, a change of control (as defined therein) constitutes an event of default that permits the noteholders to declare all of their notes to be immediately due and payable. In order to avoid events of default under each of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Credit Facilities, we may therefore have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

Risks Relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Common Stock
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to make future dividend payments, if any, may be restricted.
We have a history of paying dividends to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders when sufficient cash is available, and we currently intend to pay dividends in the future. Any determination to pay dividends on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s capital stock in the future will be at the discretion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors, subject to applicable laws and the provisions of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation (including those relating to the payment of dividends on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s convertible preferred stock), and will depend on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors considers relevant. In addition, the terms of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Credit Facilities contain restrictions on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to pay dividends. Also, Delaware law may impose requirements that may restrict ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to pay dividends to holders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
We cannot assure ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders that an active market for shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock can be sustained and the market price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock may be volatile and could decline in the future.
We cannot assure that an active public market for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock will be sustained. In the absence of a public trading market, you may not be able to liquidate yADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. The market price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock price are: industry or general market conditions; domestic and international economic factors unrelated to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s performance; changes in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers preferences; new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines; actual or anticipated fluctuations in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s quarterly operating results; changes in securities analysts estimates of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts; action by institutional stockholders or other large stockholders, including future sales; speculation in the press or investment community; investor perception of us and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry; changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies; announcements by us or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors of significant products, contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships; developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights, including increases or decreases in litigation expenses associated with intellectual property lawsuits we may initiate, or in which we may be named as defendants; failure to complete significant sales; any future sales of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock or other securities; and additions or departures of key personnel.
The stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s managements attention and resources, which would harm ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, operating results and financial condition.
Future sales of shares by existing stockholders, including ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan, could cause ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock price to decline.
Sales of substantial amounts of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could cause the market price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock to decline. Based on shares outstanding as of March31, 2017, we have 55.3million outstanding shares of common stock, including 0.3million outstanding shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s restricted stock, a significant portion of which are freely tradeable without restriction under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (Securities Act) unless held by affiliates, as that term is defined in Rule144 under the Securities Act. The remaining shares of common stock outstanding are restricted securities within the meaning of Rule144 under the Securities Act. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if their offer and sale is registered under the Securities Act or if the offer and sale of those securities qualify for an exemption from registration, including exemptions provided by Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act. In connection with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s initial public offering, we filed one or more registration statements on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock to be issued under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s equity compensation plans and, as a result, all shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of stock options granted under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s plans are also freely tradable under the Securities Act, unless purchased by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s affiliates. As of March31, 2017, there were stock options outstanding to purchase a total of approximately 2.5million shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. In addition, approximately 1.0million shares of common stock are available for grant under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s 2013 Stock Option Plan.

Certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s significant stockholders may distribute shares that they hold to their investors who themselves may then sell into the public market. Such sales may not be subject to the volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule144 of the Securities Act (Rule 144). As resale restrictions end, the market price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock could decline if the holders of those shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them.
All of the shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s convertible preferred stock held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) may be converted into ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock at any time by action of the ESOP trustee, and will be automatically converted into ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock upon distributions of such shares allocated to the ESOP accounts of ESOP participants upon a distribution event such as retirement or other termination of employment. Such distributed common stock will not be subject to any lock-up agreement and will be eligible for future sale, subject to the applicable volume, manner of sale, holding period and other limitations of Rule 144. As of March31, 2017, there were approximately 24.2million shares of convertible preferred stock held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ESOP, which in aggregate could be converted into approximately 18.6million shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. All of these shares will be eligible for future sale, either by the ESOP trustee or by ESOP participants, subject to the limitations of Rule 144.
In the future, we may issue additional shares of common stock or other equity or debt securities convertible into common stock in connection with a financing, acquisition, litigation settlement or employee arrangement or otherwise. Any of these issuances could result in substantial dilution to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s existing stockholders and could cause the trading price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock to decline.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers and principal stockholders have significant voting power and may take actions that may not be in the best interests of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s other stockholders.
As of May 5, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates collectively own approximately 51.0% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s outstanding shares of common stock.Additionally, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ESOP holds convertible preferred stock that converts into a substantial number of shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock and, prior to conversion, is entitled to vote on a one-for-one basis on any matter requiring the vote or consent of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders, voting together with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock as a single class unless otherwise required by law.Thus, the collective voting power of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers and principal stockholders and their affiliates as of May 5, 2017 is approximately 65.9%, inclusive of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP.As a result, these stockholders, if they act together, may be able to control ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management and affairs and most matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control and might adversely affect the market price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. This concentration of ownership may not be in the best interests of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s other stockholders.
The trustee of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ESOP has certain limited powers to vote a large block of shares on matters presented to stockholders for approval.
In general, the ESOP trustee votes the shares of convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP as directed by the ESOPs participants. Consequently, the ESOP trustee has the ability to vote a significant block of shares on certain matters presented to stockholders for approval. Each participant in the ESOP may direct the ESOP trustee on how to vote the shares of convertible preferred stock allocated to the participants ESOP accounts; and the ESOP trustee must vote any unallocated stock and allocated stock for which no participant instructions were received in the same proportion as the allocated stock for which participants voting instructions have been received is voted.
Anti-takeover provisions in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s charter documents and Delaware law could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of us and may affect the trading price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include a number of provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a change in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. For example, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws: authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock that could be issued by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt; maintain a classified board of directors, as a result of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board will continue to be divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered three-year terms, which prevents stockholders from electing an entirely new board of directors at an annual meeting; limit the ability of stockholders 
30
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
to remove directors; provide that vacancies on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office; prohibit stockholders from calling special meetings of stockholders; prohibit stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders; do not give the holders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock cumulative voting rights with respect to the election of directors, which means that the holders of a majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s outstanding shares of common stock can elect all directors standing for election; establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; require a super-majority stockholders vote of 75% to approve any reorganization, recapitalization, share exchange, share reclassification, consolidation, merger, conversion or sale of all or substantially all assets to which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is a party that is not approved by the affirmative vote of at least 75% of the members of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors; and require the approval of holders of at least 75% of the outstanding shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s voting common stock to amend the bylaws and certain provisions of the certificate of incorporation.
Any provision of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws or Delaware General Corporation Law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may also make it difficult for stockholders to replace or remove ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management. These provisions may facilitate management entrenchment that may delay, deter, render more difficult or prevent a change in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control, which may not be in the best interests of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders, which could limit ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers, employees or agents.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s behalf; any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stockholders by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers, employees or agents; any action asserting a claim against us arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated bylaws; or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation described above. The choice of forum provision may limit a stockholders ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers, employees or agents, which may discourage such lawsuits against us or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s directors, officers, employees or agents. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business and financial condition.

Legal Proceedings
On July29, 2015, a putative stockholder class action, Christopher Wyche, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc., et al. (Case No.1:15-cv-05955-KPF), was commenced in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court), naming ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., along with Joseph A. Chlapaty, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Chief Executive Officer, and Mark B. Sturgeon, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants and alleging violations of the federal securities laws. An amended complaint was filed on April28, 2016. The amended complaint alleges that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in its public disclosures during the period from July25, 2014 through March29, 2016, in violation of Sections10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On March 10, 2017, the District Court dismissed Plaintiffs claims against all defendants in their entirety and with prejudice. Plaintiff has appealed the District Courts order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the appeal is pending.

Subsequent to the initial voluntary production request, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. received document subpoenas from the Enforcement Division pursuant to a formal order of investigation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has from the outset cooperated

Prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s mezzanine equity also included redeemable common stock held by certain stockholders who have certain rights associated with such shares, which rights are considered to be a redemption right, which is beyond ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control and common stock subject to repurchase agreements. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s mezzanine equity consists of the redeemable convertible preferred stock held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ESOP as well the Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries related to the noncontrolling interest in the BaySaver joint venture. See Note 17. Mezzanine Equity, within ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the accounting treatment for certain of the amounts included in mezzanine equity, Note 16. Stockholders Equity, for further information regarding the accounting treatment of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Common stock subject to repurchase agreements, and Note 8. Fair Value Measurement regarding the accounting treatment for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s mezzanine equity post-IPO.
Non-GAAP Measures
Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share - Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share, Adjusted Net Income and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding, which are non-GAAP measures, are supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate Adjusted earnings per fully converted share (Non-GAAP), Adjusted Net Income (Non-GAAP), and Weighted average fully converted common shares outstanding (Non-GAAP), by adjusting ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Net income per share  Basic, Net income available to common stockholders - Basic and Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic, the most comparable GAAP measures. To effect this adjustment with respect to Net income available to common stockholders  Basic, we have (1) removed the adjustment for the change in fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock classified as mezzanine equity, (2) added back the dividends to redeemable convertible preferred stockholders and dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders, (3) made corresponding adjustments to the amount allocated to participating securities under the two-class earnings per share computation method, (4) added back ESOP deferred compensation attributable to the shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock allocated to employee ESOP accounts during the applicable period, which is a non-cash charge to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s earnings and not deductible for income tax purposes and (5) added back compensation expense recorded as a result of the January 2014 Special Dividend.

Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
We have also made adjustments to the Weighted average common shares outstanding  Basic to assume, (1) share conversion of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock to outstanding shares of common stock and (2) add shares of outstanding unvested restricted stock.
Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Board of Directors to assess ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance on a per share basis assuming all shares held by the ESOP and all shares of redeemable common stock are converted to common stock. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.

Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP. We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key metric used by management and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Board of Directors to assess ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of 
40
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
performance to evaluate the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.
Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance or cash flows from operations or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA contains certain other limitations, including the failure to reflect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cash expenditures, cash requirements for working capital needs and cash costs to replace assets being depreciated and amortized. In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA supplementally. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.
The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated.

Free Cash Flow - Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that comprises cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. Free cash flow is a measure used by management and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Board of Directors to assess ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s ability to generate cash. Accordingly, free cash flow has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a supplemental measure of liquidity that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP, because management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures.
Free cash flow is not a GAAP measure of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP.ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s measure of free cash flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.

This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the beliefs of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please read the following discussion together with the sections titled Item 1A. Risk Factors, Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements, including the related notes, included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.
We consolidate all of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint ventures for purposes of GAAP, except for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American Joint Venture and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA Joint Venture.
Overview
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the leading manufacturer of high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe, providing a comprehensive suite of water management products and superior drainage solutions for use in the underground construction and infrastructure marketplace. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s innovative products are used across a broad range of end markets and applications, including non-residential, residential, agriculture and infrastructure applications. We have established a leading position in many of these end markets by leveraging ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s national sales and distribution platform, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall product breadth and scale and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing excellence. In the United States, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s national footprint combined with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s strong local presence and broad product offering make us the leader in an otherwise highly fragmented sector comprised of many smaller competitors. We believe the markets we serve in the United States represent approximately $11billion of annual revenue opportunity. In addition, we believe the increasing acceptance of thermoplastic pipe products in international markets represents an attractive growth opportunity.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products are generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable alternatives made with traditional materials. Following ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s entrance into the non-residential construction market with the introduction of N-12 corrugated polyethylene pipe in the late 1980s, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe has been displacing traditional materials, such as reinforced concrete, corrugated steel and PVC, across an ever expanding range of end markets. This has allowed us to consistently gain share and achieve above market growth throughout economic cycles. We expect to continue to drive conversion to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products from traditional materials as contractors, civil design engineers and municipal agencies increasingly acknowledge the superior physical attributes and compelling value proposition of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s thermoplastic products. In addition, we believe that overall demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products will benefit as the regulatory environment continues to evolve.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s broad product line includes HDPE pipe, PP pipe and related water management products. Building on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s core drainage businesses, we have aggressively pursued attractive ancillary product categories such as storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings and filters, and water quality filters and separators. We refer to these ancillary product categories as Allied Products. Given the scope of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall sales and distribution platform, we have been able to drive growth within ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Products and believe there are significant growth opportunities going forward.
Key Factors Affecting ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Results of Operations
Product Demand- There are numerous factors that influence demand for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s businesses are cyclical in nature and sensitive to general economic conditions, primarily in the United States, Canada, Mexico and South America. The non-residential, residential, agricultural and infrastructure markets we serve are affected by the 
43
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
availability of credit, lending practices, interest rates and unemployment rates. Demand for new homes, farm income, commercial development and highway infrastructure spending have a direct impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations. Accordingly, the following factors may have a direct impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business in the markets in which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products are sold:
the strength of the economy;
the amount and type of non-residential and residential construction;
funding for infrastructure spending;
farm income and agricultural land values;
inventory of improved housing lots;
changes in raw material prices;
the availability and cost of credit;
non-residential occupancy rates;
commodity prices; and
demographic factors such as population growth and household formation.
Product Pricing - The price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products is impacted by competitive pricing dynamics in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry as well as by raw material input costs. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry is highly competitive and the sales prices for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products may vary based on the sales policies of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s competitors. Raw material costs represent a significant portion of the cost of goods sold for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe products, or Pipe. We aim to increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s product selling prices in order to cover raw material price increases, but the inability to do so could impact ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s profitability. Movements in raw material costs and resulting changes in the selling prices may also impact changes in period-to-period comparisons of net sales.
Material Conversion - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s HDPE and PP pipe and related water management product lines compete with other manufacturers of corrugated polyethylene pipe as well as manufacturers of alternative products made with traditional materials, such as concrete, steel and PVC. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales are driven by market trends, including the continued increase in adoption of thermoplastic corrugated pipe products as a replacement for traditional materials. Thermoplastic corrugated pipe is generally lighter, more durable, more cost effective and easier to install than comparable products made from traditional materials. We believe customers will continue to acknowledge the superior attributes and compelling value proposition of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s thermoplastic products and expanded regulatory approvals allow for their use in new markets and geographies. In addition, we believe that PP pipe products will also help accelerate conversion given the additional applications for which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s PP pipe products can be used.
We believe the adoption of HDPE and PP pipe outside of the United States is still in its early stages and represents a significant opportunity for us to continue to increase the conversion to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products from traditional products in these markets, including Canada, Mexico and South America where we operate.
Growth in Allied Products - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Products include storm and septic chambers, PVC drainage structures, fittings, stormwater filters and water separators. These products complement ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe product lines and allow us to offer a comprehensive water management solution to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers and drive organic growth. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s leading market position in pipe products allows us to cross-sell Allied Products effectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s comprehensive offering of Allied Products also helps us increase pipe sales in certain markets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Products are less sensitive to increases in resin prices since resin prices represent a smaller percentage of the cost for Allied Products.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s leading position in the pipe market has allowed us to increase organic growth of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Products. We also expect to expand ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Allied Product offerings through acquisitions.
Raw Material Costs - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s raw material cost and product selling prices fluctuate with changes in the price of resins utilized in production.We actively manage ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s resin purchases and pass fluctuations in the cost of resin through to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers, where possible, in order to maintain ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s profitability. Fluctuations in the price of crude oil and 
44
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
natural gas prices may impact the cost of resin. In addition, changes in and disruptions to existing ethylene or polyethylene capacities could also significantly increase resin prices (such as the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in late 2015), often within a short period of time, even if crude oil and natural gas prices remain low. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to pass through raw material price increases to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers may, in some cases, lag the increase in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s costs of goods sold. Sharp rises in raw material prices over a short period of time have historically occurred with a significant supply disruption (hurricanes or fires at petrochemical facilities), which may increase prices to levels that cannot be fully passed through to customers due to pricing of competing products made from different raw materials or the anticipated length of time the raw material pricing will stay elevated. For more information regarding risks relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s raw material costs, see Item 1A. Risk Factors Risks Relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Business.
We currently purchase in excess of 850million pounds of virgin and recycled resin annually from over 480suppliers in North America. As a high-volume buyer of resin, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is able to achieve economies of scale to negotiate favorable terms and pricing. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s purchasing strategies differ based on the material (virgin resin versus recycled material) ordered for delivery to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s production locations. The price movements of the different materials also vary, resulting in the need to use a number of strategies to reduce volatility.
In order to reduce the volatility of raw material costs in the future, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s raw material strategies for managing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s costs include the following:
increasing the use of less price-volatile recycled HDPE resin in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s pipe products in place of virgin resin while meeting or exceeding industry standards;
internally processing an increasing percentage of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s recycled HDPE resin in order to closely monitor quality and minimize costs (approximately 88% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s recycled HDPE resin was internally processed in fiscal year 2017);
managing a resin price risk program that entails both physical fixed price and volume contracts along with financial hedges.For ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s polypropylene virgin resin price exposure, we utilize financial hedges of propylene as a proxy for the polypropylene.
maintaining supply agreements with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s major resin suppliers that provide multi-year terms and volumes that are in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s projected consumption.
We also consume a large amount of energy and other petroleum products in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations, including the electricity we use in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing process as well as the diesel fuel consumed in delivering a significant volume of products to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s in-house fleet. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating profit also depends upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to manage the cost of the energy and fuel we require, as well as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to pass through increased prices or surcharges to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers.
Seasonality - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating results are impacted by seasonality. Historically, sales of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products have been higher in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions accelerating construction project activity during these periods while fourth quarter results are impacted by the timing of spring in the northern United States and Canada. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay projects, resulting in decreased net sales for one or more quarters, but we believe that these delayed projects generally result in increased net sales during subsequent quarters.
In the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets in the northern United States and Canada, the construction season typically begins to gain momentum in late March and lasts through November, before winter sets in, significantly slowing the construction markets. In the southern and western United States, Mexico, Central America and South America, the construction markets are less seasonal. The agricultural drainage market is concentrated in the early spring just prior to planting and in the fall just after crops are harvested prior to freezing of the ground in winter.
Currency Exchange Rates - Although we sell and manufacture ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products in many countries, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s sales and production costs are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. We have wholly-owned facilities in Canada, the Netherlands, and Puerto Rico and joint venture facilities in Mexico, Chile, Brazil, Argentina, Colombia and Peru.

The functional currencies in the areas in which we have wholly-owned facilities and joint venture facilities other than the U.S. dollar are the Canadian dollar, Euro, Mexican peso, Chilean peso, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and Colombian peso.From time to time, we use derivatives to reduce ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s exposure to currency fluctuations.During fiscal 2015, we began to implement hedging strategies to manage exposure to the Canadian dollar and, to a lesser extent, the Mexican peso, which we continued in fiscal 2016 and 2017.
Description of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Segments
We operate a geographically diverse business, serving customers in approximately 80 countries. For fiscal 2017, approximately 88% ($1,102.2 million) of net sales were attributable to customers located in the UnitedStates and approximately 12% ($155.1 million) of net sales were attributable to customers outside of the United States.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations are organized into two reportable segments based on the markets we serve: Domestic and International. We generate a greater proportion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net sales and gross profit in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Domestic segment, which consists of all regions of the United States. We expect the percentage of total net sales and gross profit derived from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s International segment to continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand globally. See Note 21. Business Segment Information, to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.
Domestic - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operating results have been, and will continue to be, impacted by macroeconomic trends in the United States.For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Domestic segment of $1,102.2million, $1,113.8million, and $1,027.9million, respectively. Unconsolidated sales for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s domestic unconsolidated joint ventures (ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver joint venture prior to July17, 2015), were $18.7million, $20.9million and $24.9million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
International - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s International segment manufactures and markets products in regions outside of the United States, with a growth strategy focused on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s owned facilities in Canada and those markets serviced through ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint ventures in Mexico and South America. Pipe manufactured in these countries is primarily sold into the same region. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s joint venture strategy has provided us with local and regional access to new markets. For fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, we generated net sales attributable to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s International segment of $155.1million, $176.9million, and $152.1million, respectively.ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment in the South American Joint Venture is accounted for under the equity method and is not consolidated for financial reporting purposes. The unconsolidated sales of the South American Joint Venture were $42.2million, $50.3million, and $58.5million, in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Recent Developments
Acquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries - In February 2017, we acquired the assets of Plastic Tubing Industries (PTI), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories, in an all cash transaction for $9.5 million. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. With the acquisition, we will increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to existing manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region.
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted EBITDA - Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as a supplemental measure of financial performance that is not required by, or presented in accordance with GAAP.We calculate adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, non-cash charges and certain other expenses.
Adjusted EBITDA is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key metric used by management and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Board of Directors to assess ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industry. In addition to covenant compliance and executive performance evaluations, we use adjusted EBITDA to supplement GAAP measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business strategies, to make budgeting decisions and to compare ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures.

Adjusted EBITDA is not a GAAP measure of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and it should not be construed as an inference that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items.In evaluating adjusted EBITDA, be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation, such as stock-based compensation expense, derivative fair value adjustments, and foreign currency transaction losses. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s presentation of adjusted EBITDA should not be construed to imply that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s future results will be unaffected by any such adjustments. Management compensates for these limitations by relying on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s GAAP results in addition to using adjusted EBITDA.ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s measure of adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.
For a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most comparable GAAP measure, see Item 6. Selected Financial and Operating Data.
System-Wide Net Sales - System-Wide Net Sales is a non-GAAP measure which equals the sum of the net sales of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Domestic and International segments plus all net sales from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s unconsolidated joint ventures (ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American Joint Venture, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver joint venture prior to July17, 2015). We use this metric to measure the overall performance of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business across all of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s geographies and markets we serve.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American Joint Venture is managed as an integral part of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s International segment, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA joint venture and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver joint venture are managed as an integral part of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Domestic segment. However, with the exception of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver joint venture which we have consolidated since we acquired it on July17, 2015, they are not consolidated under GAAP. System-Wide Net Sales is prepared as if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American Joint Venture, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA joint venture, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver joint venture were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries for all periods.

Adjusted Earnings per Fully Converted Share, Adjusted Net Income and Weighted Average Fully Converted Common Shares Outstanding - Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is a key metric used by management and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Board of Directors to assess ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial performance as if all shares held by the ESOP and all redeemable common shares were to be converted to common shares. This information is useful to investors as the preferred shares held by the ESOP are required to be distributed to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees over time, which is done in the form of common stock after the conversion of the preferred shares. As such, this measure is included in this report because it provides the investors with information to understand the impact on the financial statements once all preferred shares are converted and distributed. Adjusted Earnings Per Fully Converted Share (Non-GAAP) is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.

Selected Financial and Operating Data.
Free Cash Flow - Free Cash Flow is a non-GAAP financial measure used by management and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Board of Directors to assess ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s ability to generate cash. Management believes that Free Cash Flow provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to generate cash flow from operations after capital expenditures. Free Cash Flow does not include property, plant and equipment purchases completed through financing arrangements. Free Cash Flow should not be considered as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or any other liquidity measure derived in accordance with GAAP. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s measure of Free Cash Flow is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to different methods of calculation.

Domestic gross profit increased $18.2million, or 7.3%, to $268.0million for fiscal 2017 as compared to $249.8million during fiscal 2016.The increase was primarily the result of lower raw material costs of $38.7 million due to decreased raw material prices. The increase was offset by the decrease in net sales discussed above, a $5.2 million increase in labor and overhead costs and a $3.5 million increase in transportation expenses.
 International gross profit decreased $7.7million, or 21.7%, for fiscal 2017 over fiscal 2016 primarily due to the decrease in sales discussed above and a $6.6 million increase in labor and overhead cost. The decreases were offset by a $17.2 million decrease in raw material due to decreased raw material cost and a $1.3 million decrease in transportation expenses.
Selling expenses - Selling expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $3.0million, or 3.4%, over fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in bad debt expense of $2.9 million primarily resulting from the deterioration of five customer accounts, including a $0.6 million write off of a receivable from an unconsolidated affiliate. As a percentage of net sales, selling expenses increased to 7.3% for fiscal year 2017 compared to 6.9% over fiscal year 2016.
General and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses for fiscal 2017 increased $18.4million, or 19.9%, over fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation expense of $8.0 million for fiscal 2017 compared to a benefit of $5.1 million for fiscal 2016. Additionally, legal and professional fees increased by $6.5 million as a result of third-party consulting expenses and ongoing litigation.
Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - Loss on the disposal of assets or businesses totaled $8.5million in fiscal 2017 compared to $0.8million in fiscal 2016, a net increase of $7.7million in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016.In fiscal 2017, we recorded expenses related to three manufacturing facilities that were closed during fiscal 2017 of approximately $3.5 million and accelerated depreciation of specifically identified obsolete assets of approximately $3.0 million. In addition, we recorded $2.0 million of disposals and partial disposals of fixed assets, as compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2016. 
Intangible amortization - Intangible amortization remained relatively flat in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.
Interest expense - Interest expense from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt and capital lease obligations decreased $1.0million or 5.4% in fiscal 2017 as compared to fiscal 2016. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s average overall outstanding debt was down by $46.0 million or 11.8% for fiscal 2017 compared to the average balance outstanding for fiscal 2016. The impact of lower debt outstanding on interest expense was partially offset by higher average capital lease obligations of $6.6 million or 9.1% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016, which resulted in a decrease in interest expense.

In addition, fiscal 2016 included a loss of $0.5 million recognized for the fair value remeasurement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s original investment in BaySaver at the time we acquired a controlling interest in July 2015, whereas there was no comparable amount in the current year. The remainder of the change is primarily related to foreign exchange gains. 
Income tax expense - The provision for income taxes totaled $24.6million in fiscal 2017 compared to $23.5million in fiscal 2016, an increase of $1.1million. These provisions represent an effective tax rate of 38.0% in fiscal 2017 compared to 39.6% in fiscal 2016. The current year tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rate of 35% due principally to state and local income taxes and non-deductible expenses, partially offset by foreign income taxed at lower rates. The current year tax rate decreased from the prior year primarily due to the income tax impacts of the closure of the Puerto Rico manufacturing facility partially offset by the income tax impacts of stock-based compensation. For fiscal 2017, uncertain tax positions related to foreign jurisdictions were released due to the lapse of statute of limitations.
Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates - Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates decreased $0.9million over fiscal 2017 to a net loss of $4.3million for fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $5.2million during fiscal 2016. The net loss decreased due to the $4.0 million impairment charge related to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment in the South American Joint Venture in fiscal 2016, which was partially offset by the $1.3 million impairment charge related to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment in the South American Joint Venture in fiscal 2017 and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s share of higher net losses during fiscal 2017 of $2.5 million compared to $1.4 million during fiscal 2016. 
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest - Income attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased $2.5million, or 46.4%, to $3.0million in fiscal 2017 compared to $5.5million in fiscal year 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the net income of ADS-Mexicana.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Domestic sales increased $85.9million, or 8.4%, as compared to fiscal 2015. Domestic pipe sales increased $40.9million, or 5.3%, due to continued growth in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s N-12 HDPE and High Performance Polypropylene product lines and further gains from conversion to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products from traditional products, offsetting lower agricultural sales. Domestic pipe selling prices decreased 0.2% as compared to the prior year.Allied Product sales increased $45.0million, or 17.5%, due to strong sales volume sold primarily into the non-residential, residential and infrastructure markets. In addition, approximately $10.2million of the total Allied Product sales increase relates to the acquisition of BaySaver during the second fiscal quarter of fiscal 2016.International sales increased $24.8million, or 16.3%, to $176.9million in fiscal 2016, as compared to $152.1million in the prior year.The growth was primarily due to increased sales in Canada, including in particular the contribution from the acquisition

of Ideal Pipe, which increased sales by approximately $39.7million, helping to offset decreased sales in Mexico of $9.4million.In addition, the Canadian dollar was approximately 13% weaker against the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015, which had a negative impact on net sales for Canada of $15.2million during the year ended March31, 2016.
Cost of goods sold and Gross profit - Cost of goods sold increased $30.3million, or 3.1%, to $1,005.3million during fiscal 2016 as compared to $975.0million during fiscal 2015.

Domestic gross profit increased $70.4million, or 39.2%, to $249.8million for fiscal year 2016 as compared to $179.4million during fiscal 2015.In addition to the impact of the 8.4% increase in domestic net sales over the prior fiscal year, the increase was driven by a reduction in raw material costs of approximately 10.0%, particularly pipe resin costs. Raw material prices were flat in the first quarter and declined in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared to the prior year periods. Freight costs totaled 9.8% of domestic net sales for both fiscal 2016 and 2015. The higher freight costs relate to increased depreciation charges associated with new tractors and trailers added to the delivery fleet, which offset the benefit of lower diesel fuel.Diesel prices began to moderate towards the end of fiscal year 2015 and continued to decline throughout fiscal 2016.Diesel fuel prices during 2016 were approximately 31.0% below fiscal 2015.
International gross profit increased $9.9million, or 38.6%, for fiscal year 2016 over fiscal 2015.This was the result of the impact of a 16.3% increase in international net sales, decreased resin costs and improved gross profit performance in Mexico during fiscal 2016.
Selling expenses - Selling expenses for fiscal 2016 increased $8.0 million, or 9.9% over fiscal 2015. The increase as a percentage of net sales for fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by bad debt expense and stock-based compensation. Fiscal 2016 included a benefit of $0.5 million from stock-based compensation as compared to expense of $1.5 million for the comparable period, which was primarily the result of the impact that the decrease in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s stock price had on its accounting for liability-classified stock awards. The increase in bad debt expense of $1.6 million was primarily a result of a write off of a receivable from an unconsolidated affiliate.
General and administrative expenses - General and administrative expenses for the fiscal 2016 increased $16.6 million, or 21.9%, over fiscal 2015.The increase was primarily the result of significant increases in professional fees for accounting, audit, tax, legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the restatement of previously filed quarterly and annual financial statements as part of the preparation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Fiscal 2015 Form 10-K. There were no such amounts in fiscal 2015.These fees amounted to approximately $28.0million in fiscal year 2016. There was also an increase in salary and compensation expenses of 12%, or $3.4million, as well as incremental general and administrative expenses related to the Ideal Pipe and BaySaver acquisitions of $1.9million.There were additional increases related to higher corporate overhead including higher depreciation expense as well as increased legal and administrative costs associated with being a public company.These increases were partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation of $26.7million, which was primarily the result of the impact that the decrease in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s stock price had on its accounting for liability-classified stock awards. Overall, general and administrative expenses amounted to 7.2% of net sales compared to 6.4% in the prior year.
Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities - Loss on the disposal of assets or businesses totaled $0.8million in fiscal 2016 compared to of $0.4million in fiscal 2015, a net increase of $0.4million in fiscal

2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.Businesses sold in fiscal year 2015 related to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s GEO-flow product line, while there were no businesses sold in fiscal 2016.Dispositions of machinery and equipment resulted in a loss of $0.8million and $1.1million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and related to the replacement of assets in the normal course of business.
Intangible amortization - Intangible amortization decreased $0.6million or 5.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The decrease is mainly the result of intangible assets of $7.8million becoming fully amortized during fiscal 2015, offset by the additional amortization for the Ideal Pipe intangible assets acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and the BaySaver intangible assets acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2016.
Interest expense - Interest expense from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt and capital lease obligations decreased $0.9million or 4.7% in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. For fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. carried a higher Revolving Credit Facility balance through July 2014 until the IPO proceeds were used to reduce the Revolving Credit Facility balance.
Derivative losses and other expense, net - Derivative losses and other expense, net, increased $2.2million in fiscal 2016 to $16.6million compared to $14.4million in fiscal 2015. The increase in expense is predominantly a result of both realized and unrealized losses on hedging activities. The hedging losses in fiscal 2016 were $16.9million comprised of realized losses on cash settlements of $14.7million and unrealized losses on mark-to-market adjustments of $2.2million. This compares to a net hedging loss of $15.4million incurred during fiscal 2015, consisting of realized losses on cash settlements of $7.7million and unrealized losses of $7.7million on the unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments. In addition to the hedging losses, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. realized a loss of $0.5million upon completing the acquisition of BaySaver as a result of remeasuring ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment as of the July17, 2015 step acquisition.See Note 3. Acquisitions.The balance of the change relates primarily to foreign currency transaction activity and other insignificant gains or losses.
Income tax expense - The provision for income taxes totaled $23.5million in fiscal 2016 compared to $6.3million in fiscal 2015, an increase of $17.2million. These provisions represent an effective tax rate of 39.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to 127.6% in fiscal 2015. The fiscal 2015 effective tax rate significantly exceeded the federal statutory rate due in part to the significant permanent differences associated with non-deductible ESOP stock appreciation and stock-based compensation expense, the effect of which was increased by the near break-even amount of pre-tax income, whereas the fiscal 2016 effective tax rate more closely approximates a normal effective tax rate for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC..
Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates - Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates increased $2.9million over fiscal 2015 to a net loss of $5.2million for fiscal 2016 compared to a net loss of $2.3million during fiscal 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $4.0million impairment charge related to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s investment in the South American Joint Venture, which was partially offset by lower net losses generated by the South American Joint Venture which reduced ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s share of the losses during fiscal 2016 to $1.4million compared to $2.6million for the comparable prior year period.
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest - Income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $1.4million, or 33.5%, to $5.5million in fiscal 2016 compared to $4.1million in fiscal 2015. As noted above, the 35.0% noncontrolling interest for BaySaver is now included in the fiscal 2016 results beginning after July17, 2015.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s primary liquidity requirements are working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, and dividend payments for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s convertible preferred stock and common stock. We have historically funded, and expect to continue to fund, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s operations primarily through internally generated cash flow, debt financings, equity issuance and capital and operating leases. From time to time we may explore additional financing methods and other means to raise capital. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all.
As of March31, 2017, we had $5.1million in cash that was held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s foreign subsidiaries and undistributed earnings of approximately $28.0 million. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s intent is to indefinitely reinvest ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s earnings in foreign subsidiaries

with the exception of cash dividends paid by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ADS Mexicana joint venture. In the event that foreign earnings are repatriated, these amounts will be subject to income tax liabilities in the appropriate tax jurisdiction.
At March31, 2017, we had no undistributed earnings of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s unconsolidated subsidiaries included in retained earnings.
In February 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $50 million of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock. Repurchases of common stock will be made in accordance with applicable securities laws. The stock repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended or terminated at any time at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s discretion.
Working Capital and Cash Flows
During the fiscal 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s net decrease in cash amounted to $0.1million compared to a net increase of $3.0million during fiscal 2016. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s source of funds in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by a decrease in cash used in financing activities offset by increased cash used in investing activities and a decrease in cash used by operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s use of cash in fiscal year 2017 was primarily driven by increased inventories, capital expenditures, payment of capital lease obligations, and the payment of dividends.ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s source of funds in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by higher operating earnings and the impact of increased current liabilities, lower inventories and non-cash charges (depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation expense).ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s use of cash in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by capital expenditures, a reduction of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt, payment of capital lease obligations, and the payment of dividends. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s source of funds in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by higher operating earnings, net proceeds of $72.2 million from shares sold during ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s IPO after deduction of deferred offering costs, and the impact of non-cash charges (depreciation, amortization, compensation expense and share-based compensation expense). ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s use of cash in fiscal 2015 was primarily driven by increased inventory balances of $10.1 million the settlement of a Canadian dollar currency hedge related to the Ideal Pipe acquisition of $5.6 million, spending for acquisitions of $36.4 million, net repayment of $54.2 million of debt and payment of $9.3 million of capital lease obligations.
As of March31, 2017, we had $151.6million in liquidity, including $6.5million of cash, $120.1million in borrowings available under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Revolving Credit Facility and $25.0 million under the senior notes, described below. We believe that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cash on hand, together with the availability of borrowings under ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Revolving Credit Facility and other financing arrangements and cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, scheduled interest payments on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s indebtedness and dividend payment requirement for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s convertible preferred stock for at least the next twelve months.
As of March31, 2017, we had consolidated indebtedness (excluding capital lease obligations) of approximately $350.4million, down $1.2million compared to March31, 2016.

Working Capital - Working capital is an indication of liquidity and potential need for short-term funding. We define working capital as current assets less current liabilities.
Working capital decreased to $184.8million as of March31, 2017, from $187.4million as of March31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable of $17.9million and deferred income taxes and other current assets of $8.9 million. As disclosed in Note 1, the reduction of net current deferred tax assets is due to the adoption of an accounting standard update that requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current. These increases were largely offset by an increase in inventory of $27.9million.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
Working capital decreased to $187.4million as of March31, 2016, from $228.9million as of March31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in inventories of $30.1million and an increase in accounts payable of $7.7million and current maturities of long-term debt and capital lease obligations of $29.8million, largely offset by an increase in receivables of $32.6million.

Debt and Capitalized Lease Obligations
See Note 5. Leases and Note 12. Debt to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a discussion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s financing transactions, including the Secured Bank Term Loans, the Senior Notes and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s capital lease obligations.
Covenant Compliance
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s outstanding debt agreements and instruments contain various restrictive covenants including, but not limited to, limitations on additional indebtedness and capital distributions, including dividend payments. The two primary debt covenants include a Leverage Ratio and a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio maintenance covenant. For any relevant period of determination, the Leverage Ratio is calculated by dividing Total Consolidated Indebtedness (funded debt plus guarantees) by Consolidated EBITDA. The current upper limit is 4.0 times. The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio is calculated by dividing the sum of Consolidated EBITDA minus Capital Expenditures minus cash income taxes paid, by the sum of Fixed Charges. Fixed Charges include cash interest expense, scheduled principal payments on indebtedness, and ESOP capital distributions in excess of $10million in a given fiscal year. The current minimum ratio is 1.25 times. We were in compliance with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s debt covenants as of March31, 2017. In December 2016, we determined that certain intercompany loans between ADS Mexicana and ADS, Inc. that occurred between November 2014 and November 2015 that triggered an event of default according to the terms of the ADS Mexicana Revolving Credit Facility. On December 13, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a covenant waiver from the lenders.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, with the exception of the guarantee of 50% of certain debt of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s unconsolidated South American Joint Venture, as further discussed in Note 11. Related Party Transactions of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Form 10-K. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s maximum potential obligation under this guarantee totals $11 million as of March31, 2017. The maximum borrowing permitted under the South American Joint Ventures credit facility is $22 million.As of March31, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American Joint Venture had approximately $16.0million of outstanding debt subject to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s guarantee, resulting in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s guarantee of 50%, or $8.0million, of that amount. We do not believe that this guarantee will have a current or future effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital resources.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Certain of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application, and therefore, represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial statements. If different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reported results. We believe the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial statements.

Consolidation and Investments-ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements include ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s wholly-owned subsidiaries, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s majority owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method of accounting for equity investments where we exercise significant influence but do not hold a controlling financial interest, including ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American joint venture and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. 
Significant judgment may be necessary to determine if ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. The non-controlling interests in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s subsidiaries that are consolidated but not wholly owned by us are included in the accompanying financial statements.
We currently consolidate ADS Mexicana as the primary beneficiary. We do not consolidate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American joint venture or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Tigre-ADS USA joint venture. Changes in the primary beneficiary would change ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidation conclusion.
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts-We hold receivables from customers in various countries. Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is generally not required. 
The evaluation of the customers financial condition is performed to reduce the risk of loss. Accounts receivable are evaluated for collectability based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment.
This estimate is periodically adjusted when management becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in historical collection patterns.

Inventories- Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is determined using the FIFO method, which is based on analyses that are highly complex due to the significant number of materials purchased by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. The complexity of the FIFO analysis is further increased in periods of volatile raw material pricing. 
Market value is based on estimated net realizable value, which is based on assumptions related to deterioration, obsolescence and other judgmental factors. The valuation of inventory also involves estimates and assumptions relate to which overhead costs qualify for capitalization and in what amounts.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s lower of cost or market estimate is currently not material.
Accounting for Leases- We enter into leases for buildings, transportation and other equipment, and airplanes. Judgment is required in applying the criteria necessary to determine if a lease should be classified as a capital lease. 
Specifically, judgment is required in applying the criteria to determine if a lease should be capitalized including whether to include certain lease renewal periods in the lease term, the present value of minimum lease payments, the fair value of leased assets, and the useful lives of assets.
Changes in which renewal periods are included would impact the asset and the related liability.
Goodwill- Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. 
Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. The fair value estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain.
We performed ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s annual impairment test for goodwill as of March31, 2017. We determined for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Domestic reporting unit that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value. We determined for the remaining goodwill that the fair value exceeded the carrying value for each of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reporting units. Accordingly, we did not incur any impairment charges for goodwill in fiscal 2017, 2016 or 2015. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period.

Definite-lived intangible assets -Definite-lived intangible assets are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the asset group may not be recoverable. Asset groups are established primarily by determining the lowest level of cash flows available. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of such assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. 
Indefinite lived intangible assets-Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We base ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. To estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, we use an income approach, which utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period.
We did not record any impairment charges for intangible assets in fiscal 2017, 2016, or 2015.Future events and unanticipated changes to assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period.

Other Assets- Other assets includes equity-method investments. We evaluate other assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable, and recognizes an impairment loss when a decline in value below carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary.
Under these circumstances, we would adjust the carrying value down to its estimated fair value, which then becomes its new carrying value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
We recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s South American Joint Venture.
Revenue Recognition-We sell pipe products and related water management products. We ship products to customers predominantly by internal fleet and to a lesser extent by third-party carriers. We do not provide any additional revenue generating services after product delivery.
Sales, net of sales tax and allowances for returns, rebates and discounts are recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue when both persuasive evidence of an arrangement and the price is fixed or determinable. Title to the products and risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon delivery. We perform credit check procedures on all new customers, establishes credit limits accordingly, and monitors the creditworthiness of existing customers, which is the basis for concluding that collectability is reasonably assured.
We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment.
If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s historical experience differs from future experience, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s allowance for doubtful accounts could differ.

Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)- When shares of convertible preferred stock are allocated to the ESOP stock accounts of ESOP participants, we reduce the amount of deferred compensation reflected in Deferred compensation unearned ESOP shares in mezzanine equity. 
Shares of convertible preferred stock are valued based on an annual valuation for the ESOP by an independent third-party appraisal firm.
If the valuation of shares differ from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s estimate, it could result in a significant decrease or increase in ESOP compensation in the fourth quarter.
Stock-Based Compensation Plan-Equity-classified awards are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, and liability-classified awards are re-measured at their fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, at each relevant reporting date for accounting purposes. Liability-classified stock options are re-measured at fair value each period until they are exercised. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Determining the fair value of stock options under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires judgment, common stock volatility, expected term of the awards, dividend yield and the risk-free interest rate. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock options represent ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s best estimates, based on managements judgment and subjective future expectations. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties. 
We developed ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s assumptions as follows:
Volatility. 
Expected term. 
Risk-free interest rate.
Dividend yield. 
We estimate potential forfeitures of grants and adjust stock-based compensation expense accordingly. The estimate of forfeitures is adjusted over the requisite service period to the extent that actual forfeitures differ from the prior estimates. We estimate forfeitures based upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s historical experience and, at each period, review the estimated forfeiture rate and make changes as factors affecting the forfeiture rate calculations and assumptions change.
If any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly, stock-based compensation recorded in future periods may differ materially from that recorded previously for liability-classified awards.

Valuation of redeemable convertible preferred stock- Prior to the effective date of the IPO, the trustee of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ESOP had the ability to put the shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Redeemable convertible preferred stock to us. If ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock, which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Redeemable convertible preferred stock may convert to, is no longer a registration-type class of security (e.g., in the event of a delisting), the option held by the trustee of the ESOP, which granted it the ability to put the shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Redeemable convertible preferred stock to us, would then become applicable. Preferred securities that become redeemable upon a contingent event that is not solely within the control of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. should be classified outside of permanent equity. 
As of March31, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has determined that it is not probable that the redemption feature will become applicable. Since the Redeemable convertible preferred stock is not currently redeemable and it is not probable that the instrument will become redeemable, subsequent adjustment to fair value is not required. As such, the Redeemable convertible preferred stock was recorded to fair value at the effective date of the IPO on July25, 2014 and will remain in mezzanine equity without further adjustment to carrying value unless it becomes probable that the redemption feature will become applicable.
If the redemption feature became applicable, there would be adjustments to the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock. The current carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock are $12.50 per share in equity. Currently, the fair value of redeemable convertible preferred stock is valued at $16.80.
Income Taxes- Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and represent the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. 
Uncertain tax positions- We recognize uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes which provides guidance related to the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The standard prescribes the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. ASC 740, Income Taxes also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. 
They are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
Initial recognition, derecognition and measurement is based on managements judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. 
As of March 31, 2017, we had valuation allowances of $2.2 million and unrecognized tax benefits of $6.2 million. Although we believe ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s estimates are reasonable, if these judgments are not accurate then future income tax expense or benefit could be different.

For a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Item7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is subject to various market risks, primarily related to changes in interest rates, credit risk, raw material supply prices, and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange rates. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position, results of operations or cash flows may be negatively impacted in the event of adverse movements in the respective market rates or prices in each of these risk categories. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s exposure in each category is limited to those risks that arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative, non-operating transactions.
Interest Rate Risk
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is subject to interest rate risk associated with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s bank debt. Changes in interest rates impact the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s fixed-rate debt, but there is no impact to earnings and cash flow. Alternatively, changes in interest rates do not affect the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s variable-rate debt, but they do affect future earnings and cash flow. The Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Note, and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s industrial development revenue bond, or IDRB, notes bear variable interest rates. The Revolving Credit Facility and Term Note bear interest either at LIBOR or the Prime Rate, at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s option, plus applicable pricing margins. The IDRB notes bear interest at weekly commercial paper rates, plus applicable pricing margins. A 1.0% increase in interest rates on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s variable-rate debt would increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s annual forecasted interest expense by approximately $2.6million based on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s borrowings as of March 31, 2017. Assuming the Revolving Credit Facility is fully drawn, each 1.0% increase or decrease in the applicable interest rate would change ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s interest expense by approximately $3.9million, as of March 31, 2017. 
Credit Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. We provide ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products to customers based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition. We monitor the exposure for credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of customers comprising ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customer base and their dispersion among many different geographies. One customer has an accounts receivable balance equal to approximately 16% of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Receivables balance as of March31, 2017.
Raw Material and Commodity Price Risk
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s primary raw materials used in the production of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products are high density polyethylene and polypropylene resins. As these resins are hydrocarbon-based materials, changes in the price of feedstocks, such as crude oil derivatives and natural gas liquids, as well as changes in the market supply and demand may cause the cost of these resins to fluctuate significantly. Raw materials account for the majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cost of goods sold. Given the significance of these costs and the inherent volatility in supplier pricing, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to reflect these changes in the cost of resins in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s product selling prices in an efficient manner contributes to the management of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s overall risk and the potential impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations. A 1% increase in the price of resin would increase ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cost of goods sold by approximately $4 million.
We have a resin price risk management program with physical fixed price contracts and financial hedge contracts which are designed to apply to a significant portion of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s annual virgin resin purchases. We also maintain supply agreements with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s major resin suppliers that provide multi-year terms and volumes that are in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s projected consumption. These supply agreements generally do not contain minimum purchase volumes or fixed prices. Accordingly, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s suppliers may change their selling prices or other relevant terms on a monthly basis, exposing us to pricing risk. To manage this risk for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s polypropylene virgin resin price exposure, we utilize financial hedges of propylene as a proxy for polypropylene. Historically, the month to month change in market based pricing has been very similar between propylene and polypropylene.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s use of forward fixed price contracts, financial hedges and the incorporation of vertical integration for recycled material have increased ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s focus on efficiency and resulted in lower overall supply costs.
We began a diesel hedging program in 2008 which was executed through several financial swaps covering future months demand for diesel fuel and are designed to decrease ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s exposure to changing fuel costs. These hedges covered a significant portion of the diesel fuel consumed by the truck fleet that we operate to deliver products to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s customers. 
Inflation Risk
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s cost of goods sold is subject to inflationary pressures and price fluctuations of the raw materials we use, primarily high density polyethylene and polypropylene resins. Historically, we have generally been able, over time, to recover the effects of inflation and price fluctuations through sales price increases and production efficiencies related to technological enhancements and improvements. However, we cannot reasonably estimate ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to successfully recover any price increases.
Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk
We have operations in countries outside of the United States, all of which use the respective local foreign currency as their functional currency. Each of these operations may enter into contractual arrangements with customers or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than its respective functional currency. Consequently, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations may be affected by exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the regions in which we sell or distribute ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s products. Exposure to variability in foreign currency exchange rates from these transactions is managed, to the extent possible, by natural hedges which result from purchases and sales occurring in the same foreign currency within a similar period of time, thereby offsetting each other to varying degrees.
In addition to the foreign currency transaction-related gains and losses that are reflected within the results of operations, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is subject to foreign currency translation risk, as the financial statements for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s foreign subsidiaries are measured and recorded in the respective subsidiarys functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded net of tax impact in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Under the supervision and with the participation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management, including ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Chief Executive Officer and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), as of March 31, 2017. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified under Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) rules and forms. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.
Based on the evaluation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s disclosure controls and procedures, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2017 
66
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
because of the identified material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting, as further described below.
Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f).
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management, including ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Chief Executive Officer and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013). A material weakness in internal controls is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, even appropriate internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
Based on this assessment, management has concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, due to the fact that material weaknesses previously identified and disclosed had not been remediated. The material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, were in the areas of (i) Company control environment, (ii) accounting for leases, (iii) accounting for inventory, (iv) journal entry and account reconciliation, (v) ADS Mexicana control environment, and (vi) ADS Mexicana revenue recognition cut-off practices. 
Following the identification of the material weaknesses referenced below and first noted in fiscal 2015, and with the oversight of the Audit Committee, we have commenced a process to remediate the underlying causes of these material weaknesses, enhance the control environment and strengthen ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting.ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is still in the process of implementing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s comprehensive remediation plan as further described below. Accordingly, the previously identified material weaknesses cannot be considered remediated until each control has been appropriately designed, has operated for a sufficient period of time, and until management has concluded, through testing, that the control is operating effectively. Management has determined the following six material weaknesses, as previously disclosed, remained outstanding as of March 31, 2017:
Control Environment  ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control environment, which is the foundation for the discipline and structure necessary for effective internal control over financial reporting, was determined to be ineffective. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ineffective control environment is evidenced by: (i) an insufficient number of personnel appropriately qualified to perform control design, execution and monitoring activities, (ii) an insufficient number of personnel with an appropriate level of GAAP knowledge and experience and ongoing training in the application of GAAP commensurate with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s external financial reporting requirements, which resulted in erroneous judgments regarding the proper application of GAAP, (iii) in certain instances, insufficient documentation or basis to support account balances and accounting estimates, and (iv) certain aspects of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s tone at the top set by senior management. The material weakness in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s control environment impacts the overall effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal controls over financial reporting.
Accounting for Leases  We did not design and maintain effective control over the accounting for leases, and whether certain leases should be classified as operating leases or capital leases. We previously determined that a significant number of such leases previously treated as operating leases should instead be classified as capital leases and included in property, plant and equipment.
Accounting for Inventory  We did not design and maintain effective control over the accounting for inventory. We previously identified errors relating to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s incorrect historical calculation of 
67
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
inventory cost including the capitalization of raw material variances, excess capitalization of certain inter-plant freight expense and other overhead costs as well as misclassification of certain other overhead costs.
Journal Entry and Account Reconciliation  We did not design and maintain effective control over access within ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s information technology systems to control the ability of key accounting personnel to initiate, modify and record transactions in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial systems. It was determined that certain key accounting personnel had the ability to both prepare and post manual journal entries without appropriate independent review and approval. As these key accounting personnel are also reviewers of certain account reconciliations, we also did not maintain appropriate segregation of duties. Also, management expectations regarding the level of documentation necessary to support account balances, journal entries, accrual calculations and management estimates were not adequate.
ADS Mexicana Control Environment  We did not maintain an effective control environment with respect to certain aspects of the financial reporting of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated joint venture affiliate, ADS Mexicana, resulting in certain mischaracterized transactions.
ADS Mexicana Revenue Recognition Cut-Off Practices  We did not design and maintain effective controls over ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s revenue recognition cut-off practices with respect to ADS Mexicana. We previously identified instances where ADS Mexicana would recognize revenue, prior to the date of shipment or transfer of title/ownership, which is not in accordance with GAAP.
Deloitte  Touche LLP, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017. Deloitte  Touche LLPs opinion, as stated in their report which appears on page F-2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, is consistent with managements report on internal control over financial reporting as set forth above.
Ongoing Remediation Process
Management is committed to achieving a strong control environment, high ethical standards and financial reporting integrity. This commitment has continued to be communicated to all of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s employees and is the foundation of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation efforts. 
While certain actions have been taken to enhance ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting relating to the material weaknesses, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is still in the process of implementing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s comprehensive remediation plan. Accordingly, the material weaknesses noted above cannot be considered remediated until each control has been appropriately designed, has operated for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the control is operating effectively.
We have categorized ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation efforts into three separate initiatives which focus on people, process and technology. As management continues to evaluate and execute towards improving its internal control environment, it may be necessary to take on additional measures to fully remediate the existing material weaknesses. 
Examples of the remediation efforts that have been instituted include:
PEOPLE
Hiring of Key Positions
Ongoing Training and Development
Appointment of New Chief Financial Officer and Additional Finance Personnel

System Approval Enhancement for Journal Entries
The status of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s remediation plan is being, and will continue to be, reported by management to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a regular basis. In addition, we have assigned executive owners to oversee the remedial changes to the overall design of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control environment and to address the root causes of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s material weaknesses. Remediation generally requires making changes to how controls are designed and then adhering to those changes for a sufficient period of time such that the operating effectiveness of those changes can be demonstrated through testing.
As we continue to evaluate and work to improve ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting, we may take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s previously disclosed remediation plan. We cannot assure you, however, when we will fully remediate such weaknesses, nor can we be certain of whether additional actions will be required. See above under Item 1A. Risk Factors  We have identified material weaknesses in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ability to report ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, investor confidence in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Company and, as a result, the value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
As of March 31, 2017, testing of both the design and operating effectiveness of new and improved controls was completed related to Accounting for Stock-based Compensation, and management concluded that this material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting has been fully remediated. Except for the changes described above there were no changes in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting identified in managements evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries 
Hilliard, Ohio
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity (deficit) and mezzanine equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s responsibility is to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audits.
We conducted ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audits provide a reasonable basis for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s opinion.
In ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Advanced Drainage Systems Inc. and subsidiaries as of March 31, 2017 and 2016, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2017, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.
As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on April 1, 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted the new accounting guidance at ASU 2015-17 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes on a prospective basis.
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on the criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s report dated May 30, 2017 expressed an adverse opinion on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of 
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries 
Hilliard, Ohio
We have audited Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the "Company's") internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2017, based on criteria established in Internal Control  Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s responsibility is to express an opinion on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s internal control over financial reporting based on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audit.
We conducted ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on that risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audit provides a reasonable basis for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s opinion.
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management's assessment: an ineffective control environment, accounting for inventory, accounting for leases, journal entry and account reconciliation, an ineffective control environment at ADS Mexicana, and internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition cut-off practices at ADS Mexicana. These material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s audit of the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended March 31, 2017, of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. and this report does not affect ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s report on such consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule. 
In ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses identified above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1.
BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business - Advanced Drainage Systems,Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ADS and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.), incorporated in Delaware, designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products, primarily in North and South America and Europe. ADSs broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or HDPE) pipe, polypropylene (or PP) pipe and related water management products.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s fiscal year begins on April1 and ends on March31. Unless otherwise noted, references to year pertain to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April1, 2016 to March31, 2017.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is managed based primarily on the geographies in which it operates and reports results of operations in two reportable segments. The reportable segments are Domestic and International.
2014 Initial Public Offering (IPO) - On July11, 2014, in anticipation of the IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. executed a 4.707-for-one split of its common and its preferred stock. The effect of the stock split on outstanding shares and earnings per share has been retroactively applied to all prior periods presented.
On July25, 2014, ADS completed the IPO of its common stock, which resulted in the sale by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. of 5.3 million shares of common stock. ADS received total proceeds from the IPO of $79.1 million after excluding underwriter discounts and commissions of $5.5 million, based upon the price to the public of $16.00 per share. After deducting other offering expenses of $6.9 million, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used the net proceeds of $72.2 million to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving portion of its credit facility. The common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WMS.
On August22, 2014, an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters in connection with the IPO.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., its wholly owned subsidiaries, its majority owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments where it exercises significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are recorded in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related equity in earnings from these investments are included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, determination of the proper accounting for leases, valuation of equity method investments, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment, accounting for stock-based compensation and the ESOP, valuation of the redeemable common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, determination of allowances for sales returns, rebates and discounts, determination of the valuation allowance, if any, on deferred tax assets, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Managements estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and available information. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Receivables include trade receivables, refundable income taxes and other miscellaneous receivables, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables at March31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is generally not required. The evaluation of the customers financial condition is performed to reduce the risk of loss. Accounts receivable are evaluated for collectability based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment. This estimate is periodically adjusted when management becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in historical collection patterns.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Costs include the cost of acquiring materials, including in-bound freight from vendors and freight incurred for the transportation of raw materials, tooling or finished goods between ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s manufacturing plants and its distribution centers, direct and indirect labor, factory overhead and certain corporate overhead costs related to the production of inventory. The portion of fixed manufacturing overhead that relates to capacity in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s normal capacity is expensed in the period in which it is incurred and is not included in inventory. Market value of inventory is established based on the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence, and other factors. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and adjustments are made whenever necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Method - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired through acquisitions, which are initially recorded at fair value. Equipment acquired under capital lease is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term, if shorter, as follows:
Years
Buildings
40  45
Machinery and equipment
3  18
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or life of lease
Costs of additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the asset accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Construction in progress is also recorded at cost and includes capitalized interest, capitalized payroll costs and related costs such as taxes and other fringe benefits. Interest capitalized was $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Goodwill - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is comprised of two steps. The first step requires the comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its respective carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. With respect to this testing, a reporting unit is a component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. The fair value estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. For the fiscal 2017, ADS completed a quantitative fair value assessment of the International reporting unit and determined no impairment charge was required. 
GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of the Domestic reporting unit in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the Domestic reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed. ADS applied the qualitative assessment to the Domestic reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS 
F-17
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for goodwill in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Intangible Assets
Intangible Assets Definite-Lived- Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the asset group may not be recoverable. Asset groups are established primarily by determining the lowest level of cash flows available. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of such assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Intangible Assets Indefinite-Lived- Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. To estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses an income approach, which utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
GAAP allows entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets for the impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible assets unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of indefinite-lived trademarks in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trademarks substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed.
ADS applied the qualitative assessment to specific trademarks for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the trademarks fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for Intangible assets in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Other Assets - Other assets include investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, cash surrender value of officer life insurance on key senior management executives, capitalized software development costs, deposits, Central parts, and other miscellaneous assets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. capitalizes development costs for internal use software. Capitalization of software development costs begins in the application development stage and ends when the asset is placed into service. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amortizes such costs using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 2 to 10 years, which is included in General and administrative expense, Selling expense or Cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the nature of the asset and its intended use. Central parts represent spare production equipment items which are used to replace worn or broken production equipment parts and help reduce the risk of prolonged equipment outages. The cost of Central parts is amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of 8 to 30 years.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable, and recognizes an

Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
impairment loss when a decline in value below carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary. Under these circumstances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value, which then becomes its new carrying value. For the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Leases - Leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and assumes the initial lease term includes cancellable and renewal periods that are reasonably assured. For leases classified as capital leases at lease inception, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records a capital lease asset and lease financing obligation equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset. The capital lease asset is recorded in Property, plant and equipment, net and amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term using the straight-line method, and the lease financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method over the lease term with the rental payments being allocated to principal and interest. For leases classified as operating leases, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records rent expense over the lease term using the straight-line method.
Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated at a monthly average exchange rate and equity transactions are translated using either the actual exchange rate on the day of the transaction or a monthly average historical exchange rate. For the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) consisted entirely of foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Net Sales - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. sells pipe products and related water management products. ADS ships products to customers predominantly by internal fleet and to a lesser extent by third-party carriers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not provide any additional revenue generating services after product delivery.
Sales, net of sales tax and allowances for returns, rebates and discounts are recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. ADS recognizes revenue when both persuasive evidence of an arrangement and the price is fixed or determinable. Title to the products and risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon delivery. ADS performs credit check procedures on all new customers, establishes credit

limits accordingly, and monitors the creditworthiness of existing customers, which is the basis for concluding that collectability is reasonably assured.
Shipping Costs - Shipping costs are incurred to physically move raw materials, tooling and products between manufacturing and distribution facilities and from production or distribution facilities to customers. Shipping costs for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $120.4 million, $120.5 million, and $121.0 million, respectively, and are included in Cost of goods sold. In certain instances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bills shipping costs to customers. Shipping costs billed to customers were $5.5 million, $7.0 million, and $9.3 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in Net sales.
Stock-Based Compensation - See Note18. Stock-Based Compensation for information about ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock-based compensation award programs and related accounting policies.
Advertising - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are recorded in Selling expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total advertising costs were $3.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Self-Insurance - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for short term disability and medical coverage it provides for substantially all eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for medical claims up to the individual and aggregate stop-loss coverage limits. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues for claims incurred but not reported based on an estimate of future claims related to events that occurred prior to the fiscal year end if it has not met the aggregate stop-loss coverage limit. Amounts expensed totaled $39.5 million, $37.5 million, and $32.0 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of which employees contributed $5.1 million, $4.5 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for various other general insurance programs to the extent of the applicable deductible limits on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s insurance coverage. These programs include primarily automobile, general liability and employment practices coverage with deductibles ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million per occurrence or claim incurred. Amounts expensed during the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported at year end, were $1.8 million, $2.1 million, and $0.6 million, for the years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for workers compensation insurance with stop-loss coverage for claims that exceed $0.3 million per incident up to the respective state statutory limits. Amounts expensed, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported, were $2.1 million, $3.9 million, and $1.4 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and represent the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. They are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Penalties and interest recorded on income taxes payable are recorded as part of Income tax expense.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process, based upon the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.

Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
Fair Values -The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level2 Observable inputs other than those included in Level1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level3 Unobservable inputs reflecting managements own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
ADSs policy for determining when transfers between levels have occurred is to use the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Concentrations of Risk - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a large, active customer base of approximately twenty thousand customers with two customers, Ferguson Enterprises and HD Supply Waterworks, each representing more than 10% of annual net sales. Such customers accounted for 23.5%, 21.1%, and 20.3% of fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 net sales, respectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s customer base is diversified across the range of end markets that it serves.
Financial instruments that potentially subject ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of Receivables. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. provides its products to customers based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on Receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. monitors the exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to Receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographies. One customer, Ferguson Enterprises, accounted for approximately 15.7% and 14.0% of Receivables at March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Derivatives - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. ADS uses interest rate swaps, commodity options in the form of collars and swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage various exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore, gains and losses from contract settlements and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in Derivative losses (gains) and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also has forward purchase agreements in place with certain resin suppliers for virgin polyethylene resin. The agreements specify a fixed amount of virgin resin material to be purchased at a fixed price for a given period of time in quantities ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will use in the normal course of business, and therefore, are not subject to the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810-15Consolidation. The cost of such resin is recognized in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Consolidation  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update to make changes to consolidation guidance to address concerns of stakeholders that current accounting for certain legal entities might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entitys contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily 
F-21

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entitys voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entitys economic benefits or obligations. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April1, 2016. The update has had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs  In April 2015, the FASB issuedan accounting standards update that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that provided supplemental guidance that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. See Note 12. Debt for additional information about the impact of the adoption of the updates.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities  In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, as non-current, rather than separately record the current and non-current portions. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted. The impact of the adoption of this standard was a reduction to the net current deferred tax assets balance included in Deferred income taxes and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to zero as of March 31, 2017, with all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2017 now being classified as non-current. The update had no effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Mezzanine Equity.
Internal-Use Software  In April 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance to customers concerning whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. Under this new standard, 1) if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses, or 2) if the arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted the new standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. The amendment sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities to periods beginning after December15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date of periods beginning after December15, 2016. There have also been various additional accounting standards 
F-22
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
updates issued by the FASB in 2016 that further amend this new revenue standard. The updated standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
Measurement of Inventory  In July 2015, the FASB issuedan accounting standards update which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, simplifying current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The determination of market value, under current guidance, is considered unnecessarily complex as there are several potential outcomes based on its definition as replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. Whereas net realizable value, under the update, is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for leases. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize most leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease that has an accounting lease term of twelve months or less. The amendment also contains other changes to the current lease guidance that may result in changes to how entities determine which contractual arrangements qualify as a lease, the accounting for executory costs such as property taxes and insurance, as well as which lease origination costs will be capitalizable. The new standard also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. The updated standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the new guidance will be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements of the period of adoption. The modified retrospective transition approach includes certain practical expedients that entities may elect to apply in transition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2019. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet determined whether to apply any of the available practical expedients. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has begun the process of reviewing contracts under the new standard to determine the impact the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is also in process of implementing a new software solution to improve the process of accounting for leases under the current and new standard.
Stock-Based Compensation  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will adopt the standard on April 1, 2017. This update contains changes to the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby excess tax benefits will be recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. This standard is expected to result in increased volatility to the income tax expense in future periods dependent upon the timing of employee exercises of stock options, the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock and the vesting of restricted stock awards. Excess tax benefits will now be classified as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows.
The amendment also contains potential changes to the accounting for forfeitures, whereby entities can elect to either continue to apply the current GAAP requirement to estimate forfeitures when determining compensation expense, or to alternatively reverse the compensation expense of forfeited awards when they occur. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will account for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in expense volatility based on the timing of forfeitures.
In addition, the amendment also modifies the net-share settlement liability classification exception for statutory income tax withholdings, whereby the new guidance allows an employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation to withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory tax rate in the employees applicable jurisdiction. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. included this provision in awards issued in fiscal 2017 and 
F-23

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
modified previously issued awards on April 1, 2017. See the note regarding Subsequent Events for further information on the modification.
Measurement of Credit Losses  In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables. This accounting standards update requires the use of an impairment model referred to as the current expected credit loss model. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flow Classification  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance and distributions received from equity method investees. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. This amended guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Definition of a Business In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to clarify the definition of a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the standards update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April 1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of pronouncements described above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2017 Acquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries
On February6, 2017, ADS acquired Plastic Tubing Industries (PTI), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories. With the acquisition, ADS will increase its manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to the existing ADS manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region. The purchase price of PTI was $9.5 million, financed through the existing line of credit facility. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. The results of operations of PTI are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations after February 6, 2017. The Net sales and Income before income taxes of PTI since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March31, 2017 were immaterial.
The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price. The difference was recognized as a gain on bargain purchase in fiscal 2017. The purchase price allocation is as follows:

Fiscal 2016 Step Acquisition of BaySaver
On July17, 2015, ADS Ventures, Inc. (ADS/V), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver, increasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s total ownership interest in BaySaver to 65%, for a purchase price of $3.2 million, plus contingent consideration with an initial estimated fair value of $0.8 million. Concurrent with the purchase of the additional membership investment, the BaySaver joint venture agreement was amended to modify the voting 
F-25
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for this transaction as a business combination with BaySaver being consolidated into the financial statements after July17, 2015.
As ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for the investment in BaySaver prior to the purchase of the 10% additional membership interest under the equity method of accounting, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounted for this business combination as a step acquisition and recognized a loss of $0.5 million on remeasurement to fair value of the previously held investment. The loss is included in Derivative losses and other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver investment immediately before the July17, 2015 acquisition was measured based on a combination of the discounted cash flow and guideline public company valuation methods and involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These inputs include projected sales, margin, required rate of return and tax rate for the discounted cash flow method, as well as implied pricing multiples, and guideline public company group for the guideline public company method.
The purchase price was determined as follows:

The purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets, assumed liabilities and goodwill. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets has been determined primarily using the income approach, which involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). These inputs include projected sales, margin, required rate of return and tax rate, as well as an estimated royalty rate in the cases of the developed technology and trade name and trademark intangibles. The developed technology and trade name and trademark intangibles are valued using a relief-from-royalty method.
Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries is classified as mezzanine equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to a put option held by the joint venture partner, which may be exercised on or after April1, 2017. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance will be accreted to the estimated redemption value using the effective interest method until April1, 2017.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $2.5 million was allocated to goodwill, assigned to the Domestic segment, and consists primarily of the acquired workforce and sales and cost synergies the two companies anticipate realizing as a combined company. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

Fiscal 2015 Acquisition of Ideal Pipe
On January30, 2015, Hancor of Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., acquired all issued and outstanding shares of Ideal Drain Tile Limited and Wave Plastics Inc., the sole partners of Ideal Pipe (together Ideal Pipe). Ideal Pipe designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products used across a broad range of Canadian end markets and applications, including nonresidential, residential, agriculture, and infrastructure applications. The acquisition further strengthens ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s position in Canada by increasing its size and scale in the market, as well as enhancing manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. The purchase price of Ideal Pipe was $43.8 million, financed through cash acquired and the existing line of credit facility. The results of operations of Ideal Pipe are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations after January30, 2015. The Net sales and Income before income taxes of Ideal Pipe since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 were immaterial.

Amount necessary to reduce minimum lease payments to present value calculated at the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.
Certain leases contain residual value guarantees that create a contingent obligation on the part of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to compensate the lessor if the leased asset cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The calculation is based on the original cost of the transportation equipment, less lease payments made, compared to a percentage of the transportation equipments fair market value at the time of sale. All leased units covered by this guarantee have been classified as capital leases and a corresponding capital lease obligation was recorded. Therefore, no further contingent obligation is needed.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the fiscal years presented. The fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. and its counterparties.
When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, ADS uses industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Level3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on internal and external inputs.

There were no transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 and 3 for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions - The fair values of the contingent consideration payables for acquisitions were calculated based on a discounted cash flow model, whereby the probability-weighted future payment value is discounted to the present value using a market discount rate. The method used to price these liabilities is considered Level3, due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value.
Valuation of Redeemable Common Stock and Executive Stock Repurchase Agreements Obligations - The redemption feature of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s redeemable common stock allowing the holder to put its shares to ADS for cash, as discussed in the previous paragraph, became unenforceable upon effectiveness of the IPO on July25, 2014. As a result, the redeemable common stock was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders equity. See Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information on the IPO.
The liability associated with the executive stock repurchase agreements was valued on the same basis as the redeemable common stock, and as such is also considered a Level3 measurement.The executive stock repurchase agreements were terminated upon the IPO.As a result, this liability was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders equity. See Note 16. Stockholders Equity for more information on the executive stock repurchase agreements.
Valuation of Debt - The carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these items, or in the case of derivative instruments, because they are recorded at fair value. The carrying and fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Senior Notes (discussed in Note 12. Debt) were $75.0 million and $75.9 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2017 and $100.0 million and $101.2 million, respectively, at March 31, 2016. The fair value of the Senior Notes was determined based on a comparison of the interest rate and terms of such borrowings to the rates and terms of similar debt available for the period. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. believes the carrying amount on the remaining long-term debt, including the Secured Bank Term Loans, is not materially different from its fair value as the interest rates and terms of the borrowings are similar to currently available borrowings. The categorization of the framework used to evaluate this debt is considered Level 2.

Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
Valuation of Investment in the South American Joint Venture - During the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture equal to the difference between the fair value of the investment and the carrying value. The method used to value the investment is considered Level3 due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value. In the determination of fair value of its investment, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used a weighted income approach, based on internal forecasts of expected future cash flows, and market approach, based on comparable public companies. Significant unobservable inputs included the WACC used to discount the future cash flows, which were between 9.3% and 16.5%, based on the markets in which the South American Joint Venture conducts business. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the BaySaver joint venture. Concurrent with the additional investment in July 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also entered into an amendment to the BaySaver joint venture agreement to change the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. increased its ownership interest to 65% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver and obtained the majority of the voting rights.
As such, while ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had previously accounted for its investment in BaySaver under the equity method of accounting, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has concluded that the additional investment results in a step acquisition of BaySaver that will be treated as a business combination. As a result, the consolidated financial statements include the consolidation of BaySavers financial statements beginning on July17, 2015. See Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information.

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determined there was an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of its investment in the South American Joint Venture, resulting from a further decline of unfavorable regional economic conditions. Accordingly, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, reducing the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. The impairment charge resulted in a basis difference between the cost of the

Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of the South American Joint Venture of $4.9 million and $4.0 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The basis difference will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the underlying fixed assets, 9 years. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized $0.4 million and less than $0.1 million of amortization of the basis difference in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

appealed the District Courts order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the appeal is pending.
On August12, 2015, the SEC Division of Enforcement (Enforcement Division) informed ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. that it was conducting an informal inquiry with respect to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC..

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. established the Advanced Drainage Systems,Inc. ESOP (the ESOP or the Plan) effective April1, 1993. The Plan was funded through a transfer of assets from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s tax-qualified profit-sharing retirement plan, as well as a 30-year term loan from ADS. The Plan operates as a tax-qualified leveraged ESOP and was designed to enable eligible employees to acquire stock ownership interest in ADS. Employees of ADS who have reached the age of 18 are generally eligible to participate in the Plan on March31 after sixmonths of service. Upon retirement, disability, death, or vested terminations, (i)a participant or designated beneficiary may elect to receive the amount in their account attributable to the 1993 transfer of assets from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s tax-qualified profit sharing retirement plan in the form of cash or ADS stock with any fractional shares paid in cash; (ii)stock credited to the participants ESOP stock account resulting from the ESOPs loan repayments are distributed in the form of ADS stock, and (iii)amounts credited to the participants ESOP cash account are distributed in the form of cash. Upon attainment of age50 and sevenyears of participation in the Plan, a participant may elect to diversify specified percentages of the number of shares of ADS stock credited to the participants ESOP stock account in compliance with applicable law.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is obligated to make contributions to the Plan, which, when aggregated with the Plans dividends, equal the amount necessary to enable the Plan to make its regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest due on its term loan to ADS. As the Plan makes annual payments of principal and interest, an appropriate percentage of preferred stock is allocated to ESOP participants accounts in accordance with plan terms that are compliant with applicable Internal Revenue Code and regulatory provisions.
The carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP trust, but not yet earned by the ESOP participants or used for dividends, is reported as Deferred compensation unearned ESOP shares within the mezzanine equity section of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Compensation expense and related dividends paid with ESOP shares are recognized based upon the average annual fair value of the shares allocated. The shares allocated are for services rendered throughout the period and, therefore, a simple average is used to calculate the average annual fair value. Deferred compensation unearned ESOP shares is relieved at fair value, with any difference between the annual average fair value and the carrying value of shares when allocated being added to Additional paid in capital. The fair value of the shares allocated was $16.80, $16.35, and $22.05 per share of redeemable convertible preferred stock at March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, resulting in an average annual fair value per share of $16.58, $19.20, and $16.61 per share for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. During the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized compensation expense of 
F-42
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
$9.6 million, $10.3 million, and $12.1 million, respectively, related to allocation of ESOP shares to participants.
Required dividends on allocated shares are generally passed through and paid in cash to the participants and required dividends on unallocated shares are paid in cash to the Plan and generally used to service the Plans debt.
In the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, the ESOP committee directed the Plan trustee to retain $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in dividends on unallocated ADS shares rather than to service the Plans debt. These dividends were allocated to participants based on the total shares in their account in relation to total shares allocated at March31, 2017 and 2016.
In the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, respectively, were allocated to the ESOP participants, including, in addition to the cash dividends, less than 0.1 million and less than 0.1 million preferred shares allocated as dividends, respectively. See Note 17. Mezzanine Equity for further details on the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP.
Executive Termination Payments - ADS has employment agreements with certain executives that include potential payments to be made to those executives upon termination. The terms of the termination payments vary by executive, but are generally based on current base salary and bonus levels at the time of termination. The contractual termination payments vest upon either (1)certain contingent occurrences terminating employment such as death, disability, layoff, the executive voluntarily quitting due to a breach of covenants by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. or for other good reason or (2)the executive reaching a specified retirement age while still working for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., as defined in the individual employee agreement.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues a liability from the effective date of the executives employment agreement to the date the executive reaches the required retirement age while working for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., which is considered the service period for this obligation. The liability is estimated based on each executives current base salary and bonus levels. Because the executives vest in the termination payments equally over the relevant service period, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes the related compensation expense based on the straight-line method over the service period. If an executive terminates their employment prior to reaching the required retirement age, no payment is required and the previously-recorded compensation expense for that executive is reversed and recorded as a benefit to compensation expense in the period the executive terminates employment.
The compensation expense (benefit) recorded related to the executive termination payments for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.1 million, ($0.3) million and $0.3 million, respectively, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March31, 2017 and 2016, the executive termination payment obligation was $5.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and is included in Other accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Profit-Sharing Plan - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a tax-qualified profit-sharing retirement plan with a 401(k) feature covering substantially all U.S. eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not make employer contributions to this plan in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a defined contribution postretirement benefit plan covering Canadian employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized costs of $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Executive Stock Repurchase Agreements - In fiscal 2007, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. entered into stock repurchase agreements with certain executives, whereby ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. was required to repurchase shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock held by the executive at the current fair market value upon the executives death or certain events of termination, as defined. The amount of shares required to be repurchased by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. from the executive and which the executive or the executives heir or estate was obligated to sell to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., was limited to the anticipated proceeds from life insurance policies held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. (referred to as a mandatorily redeemable obligation). In the case where shares were not repurchased due to the fair value of the shares exceeding the life insurance proceeds, the executive or the executives heir or estate had a put right up to a set dollar amount allowing the common stock to be put to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at the current fair market value (referred to as an executives put right). The stock repurchase agreements included termination clauses such that they would automatically terminate if a change in control event or an IPO occurred prior to the executives death.
Prior to the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified all shares subject to the mandatorily redeemable obligation as liabilities and all shares subject to an executives put rights as mezzanine equity. For those shares classified as liabilities, changes in the fair value of the shares were recognized as compensation expense. The related compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 was $1.0 million, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For those shares classified as mezzanine equity, the balance was recorded in Redeemable common stock and changes in the fair value of the shares were recorded as adjustments to Retained deficit and Paid-in capital. The changes in fair value recorded as adjustments to Retained deficit was $(1.3) million for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015.
After the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. reclassified the carrying amount of the mandatorily redeemable obligation portion of the shares of $18.2 million and the executive put right portion of the shares of $1.5 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
17.
MEZZANINE EQUITY
Redeemable Common Stock - Prior to the July 2014 IPO, one of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s minority equity owners along with other shareholders who hold ownership in ADS of at least 15% (referred to as Major Shareholders) entered into an agreement which provided the Major Shareholders the right to put their common stock to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at fair value if, following the fifth anniversary of the recapitalization that occurred during 2010, a Major Shareholder demands that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. effect an IPO covering the registration of at least $50.0 million of securities, and either ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. advises the Major Shareholder that ADS will not begin preparations for an IPO within 180 days after delivery, or after such preparations have begun they are discontinued (the Major Shareholders Put Right). As the Major Shareholders Put Right was a redemption right which prior to the IPO was outside the control of ADS, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified common stock held by the Major Shareholders in the mezzanine equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value, and changes in fair value were recorded in Retained earnings.
The redemption feature of the Redeemable common stock allowing the holder to put its shares to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for cash, as discussed in the previous paragraph, became unenforceable upon effectiveness of the IPO on July25, 2014. As a result, the Redeemable common stock was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders equity. See Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information on the IPO. As a result of the IPO, there are 10.1 million shares of common stock held by Major Shareholders, which are now classified in stockholders equity.

Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
In addition, stock repurchase agreements with certain executives provided the executive or the executives heir or estate with put rights up to a set dollar amount allowing their common stock to be put to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. Prior to the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified all shares subject to the executives put rights as Redeemable common stock. After the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. reclassified the carrying amount of the shares subject to the executive put rights to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 16. Stockholders Equity for further discussion.
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock - The Trustee of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s ESOP has the ability to put shares of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. The Redeemable convertible preferred stock has a required cumulative 2.5% dividend (based on the issue price of $0.781 per share) and is convertible at a rate of 0.7692 shares of common stock for each share of Redeemable convertible preferred stock. ADS guarantees the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.781 per share. The put option requirements of the Internal Revenue Code apply in the event that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock is not a registration type class of security or its trading has been restricted. Therefore, the holders of Redeemable convertible preferred stock have a put right to require ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to repurchase such shares in the event that the common stock is not listed for trading or otherwise quoted on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, or any other market more senior than the OTC Bulletin Board. As of March31, 2017, the applicable redemption value was $0.781 per share as there were no unpaid cumulative dividends.
Given that the event that may trigger redemption of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock (the listing or quotation on a market more senior than the OTC Bulletin Board) is not solely within ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s control, the redeemable convertible preferred stock is presented in the mezzanine equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of March31, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not adjust the carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to its redemption value or recognize any changes in fair value as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not consider it probable that the Redeemable convertible preferred stock would become redeemable.
The Board of Directors approved the 2.5% annual dividend to be paid March31 of each fiscal year to the stockholders of record as of March15, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The annual dividend was paid in cash and stock on the allocated shares. During the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors approved the 2.5% annual dividend to be paid on March31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March1, 2017.
Cash and stock dividends on allocated Redeemable convertible preferred stock for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are summarized in the following table. For additional information on dividends paid to the unallocated Redeemable convertible preferred stock, please refer to Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans.

Stock Options
Liability-Classified Options  Prior to fiscal 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability associated with the exercise of the stock options through the net settlement of shares in excess of the minimum tax withholding required by law. In addition, prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had periodically repurchased shares resulting from option exercises within six months of the exercise date. As such, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for all 2000 Plan and 2013 Plan awards issued prior to fiscal 2017 as liability-classified awards.
Liability-classified stock option awards are re-measured at fair value at each relevant reporting date, and the pro-rata vested portion of the award is recognized as a liability. The stock-based compensation liability associated with stock options expected to vest within the next twelve months is recorded in Current portion of liability-classified stock-based awards, with the portion related to those expected to vest beyond twelve months recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When stock options are exercised, the 
F-46
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital at fair value. The proceeds from the exercise are also recorded as additional paid in capital.
Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. For liability-classified options, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the end of each period. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of liability-classified stock options:

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines the fair value of the options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date. This methodology requires significant inputs including the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and expiration date.

As of March 31, 2017, there was a total of $2.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity-classified stock option awards that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 2.9 years. The weighted average grant fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $7.81, $0.00, and $0.00, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock 
On September16, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the restricted stock plan, which provides for the issuance of restricted stock awards to certain key employees. The restricted stock generally vest ratably over a five-year period from the original restricted stock grant date, contingent on the employees continuous employment by ADS. In certain instances, however, a portion of the grants vested immediately or for accounting purposes were deemed to have vested immediately, including the grants to the Chief Executive Officer, which do not have a substantial risk of forfeiture as a result of different vesting provisions. Under the restricted stock plan, vested shares are considered issued and outstanding. Employees with restricted stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights on non-forfeited shares.
Prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically repurchased shares from employees within six months of the shares vesting. As such, for the periods prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering, the restricted stock awards were accounted for as liability-classified awards. In the periods subsequent to the initial public offering, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. discontinued repurchasing employee held restricted shares due to the existence of a public market for the shares. Accordingly, upon the initial public offering ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has modified the restricted stock awards from being accounted for as liability-classified to equity-classified awards and reclassified the carrying amount of the awards of $4.8 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock has been accounted for as equity-classified awards for the periods subsequent to the initial public offering. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March31, 2017.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s effective tax rate will vary based on factors, including but not limited to, overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before taxes and discrete events.The fiscal 2015 effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate due in part to the significant permanent differences associated with non-deductible ESOP stock appreciation and stock-based compensation expense, the effect of which was increased by the near break-even amount of pre-tax income, whereas the fiscal year 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates more closely approximate a normal effective tax rate for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC..

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on approximately $28.0 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries at March31, 2017 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely with the exception of cash dividends paid by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ADS Mexicana joint venture. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.

The unrecognized tax benefits are primarily recorded in Other liabilities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include potential accrued interest and penalties of $1.8 million and $2.7 million at March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
It is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to activities of the IRS or other taxing authorities, including proposed assessments of additional tax, possible settlement of audit issues, or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS for the fiscal years ended March31, 2014 through March31, 2017. The majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended March31, 2014 through March31, 2017. The foreign income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended March31, 2013 through March31, 2017.

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the Net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period.
Holders of unvested restricted stock have non-forfeitable rights to dividends when declared on common stock, and holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock participate in dividends on an as-converted basis when declared on common stock. As a result, unvested restricted stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock meet the definition of participating securities, which requires us to apply the two-class method to compute both basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders.
F-54
Table of Contents
Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc.
The dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the diluted two-class method. In computing diluted net income per share, income available to common stockholders used in the basic net income per share calculation (numerator) is adjusted, subject to sequencing rules, for certain adjustments that would result from the assumed issuance of potential common shares. Diluted net income per share assumes the redeemable convertible preferred stock would be cash settled through the effective date of the IPO on July25, 2014, as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has the choice of settling in cash or shares and it has demonstrated past practice and intent of cash settlement. Therefore these shares are excluded from the calculation through the effective date of the IPO. After the effective date of the IPO, managements intent is to share settle; therefore, these shares are included in the calculation from July26, 2014 through March31, 2017, if dilutive. For purposes of the calculation of diluted net income per share, stock options and unvested restricted stock are considered to be potential common stock and are only included in the calculations when their effect is dilutive.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s redeemable common stock is included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted net income per share.

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Dividends on Common Stock - During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on June15, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June5, 2017.
Liability-classified stock awards  On April 1, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. modified all outstanding awards to remove the provision that permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability with the net settlement of shares in excess of minimum tax withholding. Consistent with the accounting standard update in Note 1, employees can now withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory rate.
Revolving Credit Facility Waiver  On May 19, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. obtained a waiver from the lenders of the Revolving Credit Facility regarding an event of default. A material domestic subsidiary failed to join as a guarantor resulting in default. The lenders agreed to waive the default if the material domestic subsidiary joins as a guarantor by July 31, 2017.

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business - Advanced Drainage Systems,#160;Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as #8220;ADS#8221; and the #8220;Company#8221;), incorporated in Delaware, designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products, primarily in North and South America and Europe. ADS#8217;s broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or #8220;HDPE#8221;) pipe, polypropylene (or #8220;PP#8221;) pipe and related water management products.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s fiscal year begins on April#160;1 and ends on March#160;31. Unless otherwise noted, references to #8220;year#8221; pertain to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April#160;1, 2016 to March#160;31, 2017.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is managed based primarily on the geographies in which it operates and reports results of operations in two reportable segments. The reportable segments are Domestic and International.
2014 Initial Public Offering (#8220;IPO#8221;) - On July#160;11, 2014, in anticipation of the IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. executed a 4.707-for-one split of its common and its preferred stock. The effect of the stock split on outstanding shares and earnings per share has been retroactively applied to all prior periods presented.
On July#160;25, 2014, ADS completed the IPO of its common stock, which resulted in the sale by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. of 5.3 million shares of common stock. ADS received total proceeds from the IPO of $79.1 million after excluding underwriter discounts and commissions of $5.5 million, based upon the price to the public of $16.00 per share. After deducting other offering expenses of $6.9 million, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used the net proceeds of $72.2 million to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving portion of its credit facility. The common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol #8220;WMS.#8221;
On August#160;22, 2014, an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters in connection with the IPO. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $16.00 per share. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares.
2014 Secondary Public Offering (#8220;Secondary Public Offering#8221;) - On December#160;9, 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. completed a Secondary Public Offering of common stock, which resulted in the sale of 10.0 million shares of common stock by a certain selling stockholder of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at a public offering price of $21.25 per share. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.
On December#160;15, 2014, an additional 1.5 million shares of common stock were sold by a certain selling stockholder of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. as a result of the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholder to the underwriters in connection with the Secondary Public Offering. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $21.25 per share. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., its wholly owned subsidiaries, its majority owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (#8220;VIEs#8221;) of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments where it exercises significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are recorded in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related equity in earnings from these investments are included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (#8220;GAAP#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, determination of the proper accounting for leases, valuation of equity method investments, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment, accounting for stock-based compensation and the ESOP, valuation of the redeemable common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, determination of allowances for sales returns, rebates and discounts, determination of the valuation allowance, if any, on deferred tax assets, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Management#8217;s estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and available information. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Receivables include trade receivables, refundable income taxes and other miscellaneous receivables, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables at March#160;31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is generally not required. The evaluation of the customer#8217;s financial condition is performed to reduce the risk of loss. Accounts receivable are evaluated for collectability based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment. This estimate is periodically adjusted when management becomes aware of a specific customer#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in historical collection patterns.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out (#8220;FIFO#8221;) method. Costs include the cost of acquiring materials, including in-bound freight from vendors and freight incurred for the transportation of raw materials, tooling or finished goods between ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s manufacturing plants and its distribution centers, direct and indirect labor, factory overhead and certain corporate overhead costs related to the production of inventory. The portion of fixed manufacturing overhead that relates to capacity in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s normal capacity is expensed in the period in which it is incurred and is not included in inventory. Market value of inventory is established based on the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence, and other factors. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and adjustments are made whenever necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Method - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired through acquisitions, which are initially recorded at fair value. Equipment acquired under capital lease is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term, if shorter, as follows:
#160;
Years
Buildings
40 #8212; 45
Machinery and equipment
3 #8212; 18
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or life of lease
#160;
Costs of additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the asset accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Construction in progress is also recorded at cost and includes capitalized interest, capitalized payroll costs and related costs such as taxes and other fringe benefits. Interest capitalized was $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Goodwill - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment as of March#160;31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is comprised of two steps. The first step requires the comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its respective carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit#8217;s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit#8217;s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. With respect to this testing, a reporting unit is a component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. The fair value estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. For the fiscal 2017, ADS completed a quantitative fair value assessment of the International reporting unit and determined no impairment charge was required. 
GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of the Domestic reporting unit in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the Domestic reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed. ADS applied the qualitative assessment to the Domestic reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for goodwill in the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Intangible Assets
Intangible Assets#160;#8212; Definite-Lived- Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the asset group may not be recoverable. Asset groups are established primarily by determining the lowest level of cash flows available. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of such assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Intangible Assets#160;#8212; Indefinite-Lived- Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of March#160;31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. To estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses an income approach, which utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
GAAP allows entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets for the impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible assets unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of indefinite-lived trademarks in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trademarks substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed.
ADS applied the qualitative assessment to specific trademarks for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the trademarks fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for Intangible assets in the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Other Assets - Other assets include investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, cash surrender value of officer life insurance on key senior management executives, capitalized software development costs, deposits, Central parts, and other miscellaneous assets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. capitalizes development costs for internal use software. Capitalization of software development costs begins in the application development stage and ends when the asset is placed into service. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amortizes such costs using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 2 to 10 years, which is included in General and administrative expense, Selling expense or Cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the nature of the asset and its intended use. Central parts represent spare production equipment items which are used to replace worn or broken production equipment parts and help reduce the risk of prolonged equipment outages. The cost of Central parts is amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of 8 to 30 years.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable, and recognizes an impairment loss when a decline in value below carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary. Under these circumstances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value, which then becomes its new carrying value. For the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Leases - Leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and assumes the initial lease term includes cancellable and renewal periods that are reasonably assured. For leases classified as capital leases at lease inception, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records a capital lease asset and lease financing obligation equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset. The capital lease asset is recorded in Property, plant and equipment, net and amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term using the straight-line method, and the lease financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method over the lease term with the rental payments being allocated to principal and interest. For leases classified as operating leases, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records rent expense over the lease term using the straight-line method.
Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated at a monthly average exchange rate and equity transactions are translated using either the actual exchange rate on the day of the transaction or a monthly average historical exchange rate. For the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s Accumulated other comprehensive loss (#8220;AOCL#8221;) consisted entirely of foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Net Sales - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. sells pipe products and related water management products. ADS ships products to customers predominantly by internal fleet and to a lesser extent by third-party carriers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not provide any additional revenue generating services after product delivery.
Sales, net of sales tax and allowances for returns, rebates and discounts are recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. ADS recognizes revenue when both persuasive evidence of an arrangement and the price is fixed or determinable. Title to the products and risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon delivery. ADS performs credit check procedures on all new customers, establishes credit limits accordingly, and monitors the creditworthiness of existing customers, which is the basis for concluding that collectability is reasonably assured.
Shipping Costs - Shipping costs are incurred to physically move raw materials, tooling and products between manufacturing and distribution facilities and from production or distribution facilities to customers. Shipping costs for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $120.4 million, $120.5 million, and $121.0 million, respectively, and are included in Cost of goods sold. In certain instances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bills shipping costs to customers. Shipping costs billed to customers were $5.5 million, $7.0 million, and $9.3 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in Net sales.
Stock-Based Compensation - See Note#160;18. Stock-Based Compensation for information about ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock-based compensation award programs and related accounting policies.
Advertising - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are recorded in Selling expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total advertising costs were $3.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Self-Insurance - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for short term disability and medical coverage it provides for substantially all eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for medical claims up to the individual and aggregate stop-loss coverage limits. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues for claims incurred but not reported based on an estimate of future claims related to events that occurred prior to the fiscal year end if it has not met the aggregate stop-loss coverage limit. Amounts expensed totaled $39.5 million, $37.5 million, and $32.0 million for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of which employees contributed $5.1 million, $4.5 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for various other general insurance programs to the extent of the applicable deductible limits on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s insurance coverage. These programs include primarily automobile, general liability and employment practices coverage with deductibles ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million per occurrence or claim incurred. Amounts expensed during the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported at year end, were $1.8 million, $2.1 million, and $0.6 million, for the years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for workers#8217; compensation insurance with stop-loss coverage for claims that exceed $0.3 million per incident up to the respective state statutory limits. Amounts expensed, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported, were $2.1 million, $3.9 million, and $1.4 million for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and represent the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. They are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Penalties and interest recorded on income taxes payable are recorded as part of Income tax expense.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process, based upon the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
Fair Values -The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level#160;1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level#160;3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level#160;1#160;#8212; Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level#160;2#160;#8212; Observable inputs other than those included in Level#160;1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level#160;3#160;#8212; Unobservable inputs reflecting management#8217;s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
ADS#8217;s policy for determining when transfers between levels have occurred is to use the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Concentrations of Risk - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a large, active customer base of approximately twenty thousand customers with two customers, Ferguson Enterprises and HD Supply Waterworks, each representing more than 10% of annual net sales. Such customers accounted for 23.5%, 21.1%, and 20.3% of fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 net sales, respectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s customer base is diversified across the range of end markets that it serves.
Financial instruments that potentially subject ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of Receivables. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. provides its products to customers based on an evaluation of the customers#8217; financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on Receivables is principally dependent on each customer#8217;s financial condition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. monitors the exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to Receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographies. One customer, Ferguson Enterprises, accounted for approximately 15.7% and 14.0% of Receivables at March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Derivatives - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. ADS uses interest rate swaps, commodity options in the form of collars and swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage various exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore, gains and losses from contract settlements and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in Derivative losses (gains) and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also has forward purchase agreements in place with certain resin suppliers for virgin polyethylene resin. The agreements specify a fixed amount of virgin resin material to be purchased at a fixed price for a given period of time in quantities ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will use in the normal course of business, and therefore, are not subject to the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (#8220;ASC#8221;) 810-15nbsp;nbsp;Consolidation. The cost of such resin is recognized in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Consolidation #8212; In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (#8220;FASB#8221;) issued an accounting standards update to make changes to consolidation guidance to address concerns of stakeholders that current accounting for certain legal entities might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entity#8217;s contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity#8217;s voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entity#8217;s economic benefits or obligations. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December#160;15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April#160;1, 2016. The update has had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs #8212; In April 2015, the FASB issued#160;an accounting standards update that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that provided supplemental guidance that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December#160;15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April#160;1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. See Note 12. Debt for additional information about the impact of the adoption of the updates.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities #8212; In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, as non-current, rather than separately record the current and non-current portions. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December#160;15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted. The impact of the adoption of this standard was a reduction to the net current deferred tax assets balance included in Deferred income taxes and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to zero as of March 31, 2017, with all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2017 now being classified as non-current. The update had no effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders#8217; Equity and Mezzanine Equity.
Internal-Use Software #8211; In April 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance to customers concerning whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. Under this new standard, 1) if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses, or 2) if the arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted the new standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Revenue Recognition #8212; In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. The amendment sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities to periods beginning after December#160;15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date of periods beginning after December#160;15, 2016. There have also been various additional accounting standards updates issued by the FASB in 2016 that further amend this new revenue standard. The updated standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
Measurement of Inventory #8212; In July 2015, the FASB issued#160;an accounting standards update which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, simplifying current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The determination of market value, under current guidance, is considered unnecessarily complex as there are several potential outcomes based on its definition as replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. Whereas net realizable value, under the update, is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December#160;15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Leases #8212; In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for leases. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize most leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease that has an accounting lease term of twelve months or less. The amendment also contains other changes to the current lease guidance that may result in changes to how entities determine which contractual arrangements qualify as a lease, the accounting for executory costs such as property taxes and insurance, as well as which lease origination costs will be capitalizable. The new standard also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. The updated standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the new guidance will be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements of the period of adoption. The modified retrospective transition approach includes certain practical expedients that entities may elect to apply in transition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2019. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet determined whether to apply any of the available practical expedients. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has begun the process of reviewing contracts under the new standard to determine the impact the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is also in process of implementing a new software solution to improve the process of accounting for leases under the current and new standard.
Stock-Based Compensation #8212; In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will adopt the standard on April 1, 2017. This update contains changes to the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby excess tax benefits will be recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. This standard is expected to result in increased volatility to the income tax expense in future periods dependent upon the timing of employee exercises of stock options, the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock and the vesting of restricted stock awards. Excess tax benefits will now be classified as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows.
The amendment also contains potential changes to the accounting for forfeitures, whereby entities can elect to either continue to apply the current GAAP requirement to estimate forfeitures when determining compensation expense, or to alternatively reverse the compensation expense of forfeited awards when they occur. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will account for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in expense volatility based on the timing of forfeitures.
In addition, the amendment also modifies the net-share settlement liability classification exception for statutory income tax withholdings, whereby the new guidance allows an employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation to withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee#8217;s applicable jurisdiction. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. included this provision in awards issued in fiscal 2017 and modified previously issued awards on April 1, 2017. See the note regarding Subsequent Events for further information on the modification.
Measurement of Credit Losses #8212; In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables. This accounting standards update requires the use of an impairment model referred to as the current expected credit loss model. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flow Classification #8212; In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance and distributions received from equity method investees. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. This amended guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Definition of a Business#160;#8211; In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to clarify the definition of a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.#160;The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December#160;15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill Impairment#160;#8211; In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the standards update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit#8217;s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April 1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of pronouncements described above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements.

LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS AND COSTS FROM EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES
Periodically, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will dispose of equipment, including equipment accounted for as capital leases. The net loss on the disposition of the equipment was $8.5 million, $0.8 million, and $1.1 million during the fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded expenses related to three manufacturing facilities that were closed during fiscal 2017 of approximately $3.5 million. In addition, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accelerated depreciation of specifically identified obsolete assets of approximately $3.0 million, and recorded $2.0 million of disposals and partial disposals of fixed assets.
In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. completed the sale of product-related intellectual property rights that were not significant. The sales price was $0.8 million, consisting of a cash payment of $0.2 million plus other consideration in the form of a note receivable for $0.6 million. The sale did not involve any tangible assets, and the related intellectual property rights had no net book value, resulting in a net gain recognized of $0.8 million.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2017 Acquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries
On February#160;6, 2017, ADS acquired Plastic Tubing Industries (#8220;PTI#8221;), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories. With the acquisition, ADS will increase its manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to the existing ADS manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region. The purchase price of PTI was $9.5 million, financed through the existing line of credit facility. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. The results of operations of PTI are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations after February 6, 2017. The Net sales and Income before income taxes of PTI since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March#160;31, 2017 were immaterial.
The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price. The difference was recognized as a gain on bargain purchase in fiscal 2017. The purchase price allocation is as follows:

Fiscal 2016 Step Acquisition of BaySaver
On July#160;17, 2015, ADS Ventures, Inc. (#8220;ADS/V#8221;), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver, increasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s total ownership interest in BaySaver to 65%, for a purchase price of $3.2 million, plus contingent consideration with an initial estimated fair value of $0.8 million. Concurrent with the purchase of the additional membership investment, the BaySaver joint venture agreement was amended to modify the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for this transaction as a business combination with BaySaver being consolidated into the financial statements after July#160;17, 2015.
As ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for the investment in BaySaver prior to the purchase of the 10% additional membership interest under the equity method of accounting, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounted for this business combination as a step acquisition and recognized a loss of $0.5 million on remeasurement to fair value of the previously held investment. The loss is included in Derivative losses and other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver investment immediately before the July#160;17, 2015 acquisition was measured based on a combination of the discounted cash flow and guideline public company valuation methods and involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These inputs include projected sales, margin, required rate of return and tax rate for the discounted cash flow method, as well as implied pricing multiples, and guideline public company group for the guideline public company method.

The fair value of identifiable intangible assets has been determined primarily using the income approach, which involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). These inputs include projected sales, margin, required rate of return and tax rate, as well as an estimated royalty rate in the cases of the developed technology and trade name and trademark intangibles. The developed technology and trade name and trademark intangibles are valued using a relief-from-royalty method.
Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries is classified as mezzanine equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to a put option held by the joint venture partner, which may be exercised on or after April#160;1, 2017. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance will be accreted to the estimated redemption value using the effective interest method until April#160;1, 2017.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $2.5 million was allocated to goodwill, assigned to the Domestic segment, and consists primarily of the acquired workforce and sales and cost synergies the two companies anticipate realizing as a combined company. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

Fiscal 2015 Acquisition of Ideal Pipe
On January#160;30, 2015, Hancor of Canada, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., acquired all issued and outstanding shares of Ideal Drain Tile Limited and Wave Plastics Inc., the sole partners of Ideal Pipe (together #8220;Ideal Pipe#8221;). Ideal Pipe designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products used across a broad range of Canadian end markets and applications, including nonresidential, residential, agriculture, and infrastructure applications. The acquisition further strengthens ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s position in Canada by increasing its size and scale in the market, as well as enhancing manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. The purchase price of Ideal Pipe was $43.8 million, financed through cash acquired and the existing line of credit facility. The results of operations of Ideal Pipe are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations after January#160;30, 2015. The Net sales and Income before income taxes of Ideal Pipe since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March#160;31, 2015 were immaterial.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $10.7 million was allocated to goodwill, assigned to the International segment, and consists primarily of the acquired workforce and synergies the two companies anticipate realizing as a combined company.

Transaction costs were immaterial. However, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did incur a loss on a currency hedge related to the purchase of Ideal Pipe in the amount of $5.6 million which was recorded in Derivatives losses (gains) and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used this currency hedge to fix the purchase price which was denominated in Canadian dollars from the agreement date until the transaction ultimately closed on January#160;30, 2015.
The acquired identifiable intangible assets represent customer relationships of $4.9 million (seven-year useful life), trade name of $3.1 million (10-year useful life), and non-compete agreements of $0.3 million (three-year useful life). The following table contains unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations information assuming the acquisition occurred on April#160;1, 2014 and includes adjustments for amortization of intangibles, depreciation of fixed assets and interest expense.

(b)
Amount necessary to reduce minimum lease payments to present value calculated at the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.
Certain leases contain residual value guarantees that create a contingent obligation on the part of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to compensate the lessor if the leased asset cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The calculation is based on the original cost of the transportation equipment, less lease payments made, compared to a percentage of the transportation equipment#8217;s fair market value at the time of sale. All leased units covered by this guarantee have been classified as capital leases and a corresponding capital lease obligation was recorded. Therefore, no further contingent obligation is needed.
Operating leases - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. leases certain real estate and office equipment under various cancellable and non-cancellable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through fiscal year 2037. 
Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as of March#160;31, 2017, are summarized below (amounts in thousands):

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the fiscal years presented. The fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. and its counterparties.
When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, ADS uses industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Level#160;3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on internal and external inputs.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements

There were no transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 and 3 for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions - The fair values of the contingent consideration payables for acquisitions were calculated based on a discounted cash flow model, whereby the probability-weighted future payment value is discounted to the present value using a market discount rate. The method used to price these liabilities is considered Level#160;3, due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value.
Valuation of Redeemable Common Stock and Executive Stock Repurchase Agreements Obligations - The redemption feature of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s redeemable common stock allowing the holder to put its shares to ADS for cash, as discussed in the previous paragraph, became unenforceable upon effectiveness of the IPO on July#160;25, 2014. As a result, the redeemable common stock was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders#8217; equity. See Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information on the IPO.
The liability associated with the executive stock repurchase agreements was valued on the same basis as the redeemable common stock, and as such is also considered a Level#160;3 measurement.#160;The executive stock repurchase agreements were terminated upon the IPO.#160;As a result, this liability was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders#8217; equity. See Note 16. Stockholders#8217; Equity for more information on the executive stock repurchase agreements.
Valuation of Debt - The carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these items, or in the case of derivative instruments, because they are recorded at fair value. The carrying and fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s Senior Notes (discussed in Note 12. Debt) were $75.0 million and $75.9 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2017 and $100.0 million and $101.2 million, respectively, at March 31, 2016. The fair value of the Senior Notes was determined based on a comparison of the interest rate and terms of such borrowings to the rates and terms of similar debt available for the period. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. believes the carrying amount on the remaining long-term debt, including the Secured Bank Term Loans, is not materially different from its fair value as the interest rates and terms of the borrowings are similar to currently available borrowings. The categorization of the framework used to evaluate this debt is considered Level 2.
Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
Valuation of Investment in the South American Joint Venture - During the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture equal to the difference between the fair value of the investment and the carrying value. The method used to value the investment is considered Level#160;3 due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value. In the determination of fair value of its investment, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used a weighted income approach, based on internal forecasts of expected future cash flows, and market approach, based on comparable public companies. Significant unobservable inputs included the WACC used to discount the future cash flows, which were between 9.3% and 16.5%, based on the markets in which the South American Joint Venture conducts business. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

BaySaver - BaySaver was established in July 2013 to design, engineer, manufacture, market and sell water quality filters and separators used in the removal of sediment and pollution from storm water anywhere in the world except New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s original investment represented a 55% equity interest and a 50% voting interest in BaySaver. On July#160;17, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the BaySaver joint venture. Concurrent with the additional investment in July 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also entered into an amendment to the BaySaver joint venture agreement to change the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. increased its ownership interest to 65% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver and obtained the majority of the voting rights.
As such, while ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had previously accounted for its investment in BaySaver under the equity method of accounting, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has concluded that the additional investment results in a step acquisition of BaySaver that will be treated as a business combination. As a result, the consolidated financial statements include the consolidation of BaySaver#8217;s financial statements beginning on July#160;17, 2015. See Note 3. Acquisitions for additional information.
The table below includes the assets and liabilities of BaySaver that are consolidated as of March#160;31, 2017 and 2016. The balances exclude intercompany transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation.

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. participates in two unconsolidated joint ventures, South American Joint Venture, which is 50% owned by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary ADS Chile, and Tigre-ADS USA, Inc. (#8220;Tigre-ADS USA#8221;), which is 49% owned by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s wholly-owned subsidiary ADS Ventures, Inc. In each case, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has concluded that it is appropriate to account for these investments using the equity method, whereby ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s share of the income or loss of the joint venture is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under Equity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated affiliates and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s investment in the joint venture is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
South American Joint Venture - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s investment in this unconsolidated joint venture was formed for the purpose of expanding upon the growth of manufacturing and selling HDPE corrugated pipe in the South American market via the joint venture partner#8217;s local presence and expertise throughout the region.

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determined there was an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of its investment in the South American Joint Venture, resulting from a further decline of unfavorable regional economic conditions. Accordingly, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, reducing the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. The impairment charge resulted in a basis difference between the cost of the investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of the South American Joint Venture of $4.9 million and $4.0 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The basis difference will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the underlying fixed assets, 9 years. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized $0.4 million and less than $0.1 million of amortization of the basis difference in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Litigation
On July#160;29, 2015, a putative stockholder class action, Christopher Wyche, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc., et al. (Case No.#160;1:15-cv-05955-KPF), was commenced in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the #8220;District Court#8221;), naming ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., along with Joseph A. Chlapaty, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s Chief Executive Officer, and Mark B. Sturgeon, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants and alleging violations of the federal securities laws. An amended complaint was filed on April#160;28, 2016. The amended complaint alleges that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in its public disclosures during the period from July#160;25, 2014 through March#160;29, 2016, in violation of Sections#160;10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On March 10, 2017, the District Court dismissed Plaintiff#8217;s claims against all defendants in their entirety and with prejudice. Plaintiff has appealed the District Court#8217;s order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the appeal is pending.
On August#160;12, 2015, the SEC Division of Enforcement (#8220;Enforcement Division#8221;) informed ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. that it was conducting an informal inquiry with respect to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. As part of this inquiry, the Enforcement Division requested the voluntary production of certain documents generally related to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s accounting practices. Subsequent to the initial voluntary production request, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. received document subpoenas from the Enforcement Division pursuant to a formal order of investigation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has from the outset cooperated with the Enforcement Division#8217;s investigation and intends to continue to do so. While it is reasonably possible that this investigation ultimately could be resolved unfavorably to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently unable to estimate the range of possible losses, but they could be material.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is involved from time to time in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s business, including but not limited to commercial disputes, environmental matters, employee related claims, intellectual property disputes and litigation in connection with transactions including acquisitions and divestitures. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not believe that such litigation, claims, and administrative proceedings will have a material adverse impact on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial position or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s results of operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records a liability when a loss is considered probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

ESOP (the #8220;ESOP#8221; or the #8220;Plan#8221;) effective April#160;1, 1993. The Plan was funded through a transfer of assets from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s tax-qualified profit-sharing retirement plan, as well as a 30-year term loan from ADS. The Plan operates as a tax-qualified leveraged ESOP and was designed to enable eligible employees to acquire stock ownership interest in ADS. Employees of ADS who have reached the age of 18 are generally eligible to participate in the Plan on March#160;31 after six#160;months of service. Upon retirement, disability, death, or vested terminations, (i)#160;a participant or designated beneficiary may elect to receive the amount in their account attributable to the 1993 transfer of assets from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s tax-qualified profit sharing retirement plan in the form of cash or ADS stock with any fractional shares paid in cash; (ii)#160;stock credited to the participants#8217; ESOP stock account resulting from the ESOP#8217;s loan repayments are distributed in the form of ADS stock, and (iii)#160;amounts credited to the participants#8217; ESOP cash account are distributed in the form of cash. Upon attainment of age#160;50 and seven#160;years of participation in the Plan, a participant may elect to diversify specified percentages of the number of shares of ADS stock credited to the participant#8217;s ESOP stock account in compliance with applicable law.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is obligated to make contributions to the Plan, which, when aggregated with the Plan#8217;s dividends, equal the amount necessary to enable the Plan to make its regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest due on its term loan to ADS. As the Plan makes annual payments of principal and interest, an appropriate percentage of preferred stock is allocated to ESOP participants#8217; accounts in accordance with plan terms that are compliant with applicable Internal Revenue Code and regulatory provisions.
The carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP trust, but not yet earned by the ESOP participants or used for dividends, is reported as Deferred compensation#160;#8212; unearned ESOP shares within the mezzanine equity section of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Compensation expense and related dividends paid with ESOP shares are recognized based upon the average annual fair value of the shares allocated. The shares allocated are for services rendered throughout the period and, therefore, a simple average is used to calculate the average annual fair value. Deferred compensation#160;#8212; unearned ESOP shares is relieved at fair value, with any difference between the annual average fair value and the carrying value of shares when allocated being added to Additional paid in capital. The fair value of the shares allocated was $16.80, $16.35, and $22.05 per share of redeemable convertible preferred stock at March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, resulting in an average annual fair value per share of $16.58, $19.20, and $16.61 per share for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. During the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized compensation expense of $9.6 million, $10.3 million, and $12.1 million, respectively, related to allocation of ESOP shares to participants.
Required dividends on allocated shares are generally passed through and paid in cash to the participants and required dividends on unallocated shares are paid in cash to the Plan and generally used to service the Plan#8217;s debt.
In the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, the ESOP committee directed the Plan trustee to retain $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in dividends on unallocated ADS shares rather than to service the Plan#8217;s debt. These dividends were allocated to participants based on the total shares in their account in relation to total shares allocated at March#160;31, 2017 and 2016.
In the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, respectively, were allocated to the ESOP participants, including, in addition to the cash dividends, less than 0.1 million and less than 0.1 million preferred shares allocated as dividends, respectively. See Note 17. Mezzanine Equity for further details on the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP.
Executive Termination Payments - ADS has employment agreements with certain executives that include potential payments to be made to those executives upon termination. The terms of the termination payments vary by executive, but are generally based on current base salary and bonus levels at the time of termination. The contractual termination payments vest upon either (1)#160;certain contingent occurrences terminating employment such as death, disability, layoff, the executive voluntarily quitting due to a breach of covenants by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. or for other #8220;good reason#8221; or (2)#160;the executive reaching a specified retirement age while still working for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., as defined in the individual employee agreement.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues a liability from the effective date of the executive#8217;s employment agreement to the date the executive reaches the required retirement age while working for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., which is considered the service period for this obligation. The liability is estimated based on each executive#8217;s current base salary and bonus levels. Because the executives vest in the termination payments equally over the relevant service period, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes the related compensation expense based on the straight-line method over the service period. If an executive terminates their employment prior to reaching the required retirement age, no payment is required and the previously-recorded compensation expense for that executive is reversed and recorded as a benefit to compensation expense in the period the executive terminates employment.
The compensation expense (benefit) recorded related to the executive termination payments for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.1 million, ($0.3) million and $0.3 million, respectively, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, the executive termination payment obligation was $5.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and is included in Other accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Profit-Sharing Plan - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a tax-qualified profit-sharing retirement plan with a 401(k) feature covering substantially all U.S. eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not make employer contributions to this plan in the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a defined contribution postretirement benefit plan covering Canadian employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized costs of $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

STOCKHOLDERS#8217; EQUITY
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no purchases of common stock. During the fiscal year ended March#160;31, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. purchased a negligible amount of fractional shares subsequent to the IPO at a price of $17.21 per share.
See Note 12. Debt for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed under the Secured Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes agreements.
Executive Stock Repurchase Agreements - In fiscal 2007, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. entered into stock repurchase agreements with certain executives, whereby ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. was required to repurchase shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s common stock held by the executive at the current fair market value upon the executive#8217;s death or certain events of termination, as defined. The amount of shares required to be repurchased by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. from the executive and which the executive or the executive#8217;s heir or estate was obligated to sell to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., was limited to the anticipated proceeds from life insurance policies held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. (referred to as a mandatorily redeemable obligation). In the case where shares were not repurchased due to the fair value of the shares exceeding the life insurance proceeds, the executive or the executive#8217;s heir or estate had a put right up to a set dollar amount allowing the common stock to be put to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at the current fair market value (referred to as an executive#8217;s put right). The stock repurchase agreements included termination clauses such that they would automatically terminate if a change in control event or an IPO occurred prior to the executive#8217;s death.
Prior to the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified all shares subject to the mandatorily redeemable obligation as liabilities and all shares subject to an executive#8217;s put rights as mezzanine equity. For those shares classified as liabilities, changes in the fair value of the shares were recognized as compensation expense. The related compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March#160;31, 2015 was $1.0 million, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For those shares classified as mezzanine equity, the balance was recorded in Redeemable common stock and changes in the fair value of the shares were recorded as adjustments to Retained deficit and Paid-in capital. The changes in fair value recorded as adjustments to Retained deficit was $(1.3) million for the fiscal year ended March#160;31, 2015.
After the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. reclassified the carrying amount of the mandatorily redeemable obligation portion of the shares of $18.2 million and the executive put right portion of the shares of $1.5 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

MEZZANINE EQUITY
Redeemable Common Stock - Prior to the July 2014 IPO, one of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s minority equity owners along with other shareholders who hold ownership in ADS of at least 15% (referred to as #8220;Major Shareholders#8221;) entered into an agreement which provided the Major Shareholders the right to put their common stock to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at fair value if, following the fifth anniversary of the recapitalization that occurred during 2010, a Major Shareholder demands that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. effect an IPO covering the registration of at least $50.0 million of securities, and either ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. advises the Major Shareholder that ADS will not begin preparations for an IPO within 180 days after delivery, or after such preparations have begun they are discontinued (the #8220;Major Shareholders#8217; Put Right#8221;). As the Major Shareholders#8217; Put Right was a redemption right which prior to the IPO was outside the control of ADS, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified common stock held by the Major Shareholders in the mezzanine equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value, and changes in fair value were recorded in Retained earnings.
The redemption feature of the Redeemable common stock allowing the holder to put its shares to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for cash, as discussed in the previous paragraph, became unenforceable upon effectiveness of the IPO on July#160;25, 2014. As a result, the Redeemable common stock was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders#8217; equity. See Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information on the IPO. As a result of the IPO, there are 10.1 million shares of common stock held by Major Shareholders, which are now classified in stockholders#8217; equity.
In addition, stock repurchase agreements with certain executives provided the executive or the executive#8217;s heir or estate with put rights up to a set dollar amount allowing their common stock to be put to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. Prior to the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified all shares subject to the executive#8217;s put rights as Redeemable common stock. After the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. reclassified the carrying amount of the shares subject to the executive put rights to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 16. Stockholders#8217; Equity for further discussion.
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock - The Trustee of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s ESOP has the ability to put shares of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. The Redeemable convertible preferred stock has a required cumulative 2.5% dividend (based on the issue price of $0.781 per share) and is convertible at a rate of 0.7692 shares of common stock for each share of Redeemable convertible preferred stock. ADS guarantees the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.781 per share. The put option requirements of the Internal Revenue Code apply in the event that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s common stock is not a registration type class of security or its trading has been restricted. Therefore, the holders of Redeemable convertible preferred stock have a put right to require ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to repurchase such shares in the event that the common stock is not listed for trading or otherwise quoted on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, or any other market more senior than the OTC Bulletin Board. As of March#160;31, 2017, the applicable redemption value was $0.781 per share as there were no unpaid cumulative dividends.
Given that the event that may trigger redemption of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock (the listing or quotation on a market more senior than the OTC Bulletin Board) is not solely within ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s control, the redeemable convertible preferred stock is presented in the mezzanine equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of March#160;31, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not adjust the carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to its redemption value or recognize any changes in fair value as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not consider it probable that the Redeemable convertible preferred stock would become redeemable.
The Board of Directors approved the 2.5% annual dividend to be paid March#160;31 of each fiscal year to the stockholders of record as of March#160;15, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The annual dividend was paid in cash and stock on the allocated shares. During the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors approved the 2.5% annual dividend to be paid on March#160;31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March#160;1, 2017.
Cash and stock dividends on allocated Redeemable convertible preferred stock for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are summarized in the following table. For additional information on dividends paid to the unallocated Redeemable convertible preferred stock, please refer to Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries - On July#160;17, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver#8217;s issued and outstanding membership interests, increasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s total ownership to 65%. Concurrent with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s purchase of the additional membership investment, the BaySaver joint venture agreement was amended to change the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for this transaction as a business combination and BaySaver is consolidated into ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial statements after July#160;17, 2015.
The membership interests held by the joint venture partner are presented in Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is classified as mezzanine equity, due to a put option held by the joint venture partner which may be exercised on or after April#160;1, 2017. The Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries balance will be accreted to the redemption value using the effective interest method until April#160;1, 2017. See Note 3. Acquisitions for further discussion of the BaySaver transaction.

Stock Options
Liability-Classified Options #8211; Prior to fiscal 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability associated with the exercise of the stock options through the net settlement of shares in excess of the minimum tax withholding required by law. In addition, prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had periodically repurchased shares resulting from option exercises within six months of the exercise date. As such, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for all 2000 Plan and 2013 Plan awards issued prior to fiscal 2017 as liability-classified awards.
Liability-classified stock option awards are re-measured at fair value at each relevant reporting date, and the pro-rata vested portion of the award is recognized as a liability. The stock-based compensation liability associated with stock options expected to vest within the next twelve months is recorded in Current portion of liability-classified stock-based awards, with the portion related to those expected to vest beyond twelve months recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When stock options are exercised, the liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital at fair value. The proceeds from the exercise are also recorded as additional paid in capital.
Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee#8217;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. For liability-classified options, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the end of each period. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of liability-classified stock options:

2000 Plan - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s 2000 stock option plan (#8220;2000 Plan#8221;) provides for the issuance of statutory and non-statutory stock options to management based upon the discretion of the Board of Directors. The plan generally provides for grants with the exercise price equal to fair value on the date of grant, which vest in three equal annual amounts beginning in year#160;five and expire after approximately 10#160;years from issuance. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 1.1 million shares available for grant under the 2000 Plan as of March 31, 2017.

As of March#160;31, 2017, there was a total of $3.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards under the 2013 Plan that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 1.1 years.
The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and currently exercisable as of March#160;31, 2017 was $14.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $3.4 million, $3.6 million, and $7.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.8 million. #160;#160;
Equity-Classified Options - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for awards under the 2013 Plan granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as equity-classified awards as employees are no longer permitted to satisfy their personal tax liability in excess of the minimum statutory withholding. Equity-classified stock option awards are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value of each award. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee#8217;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines the fair value of the options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date. This methodology requires significant inputs including the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s common stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and expiration date. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the equity-classified stock options:

As of March 31, 2017, there was a total of $2.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity-classified stock option awards that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 2.9 years. The weighted average grant fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $7.81, $0.00, and $0.00, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million, respectively. There were no options exercised during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Restricted Stock 
On September#160;16, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the restricted stock plan, which provides for the issuance of restricted stock awards to certain key employees. The restricted stock generally vest ratably over a five-year period from the original restricted stock grant date, contingent on the employee#8217;s continuous employment by ADS. In certain instances, however, a portion of the grants vested immediately or for accounting purposes were deemed to have vested immediately, including the grants to the Chief Executive Officer, which do not have a substantial risk of forfeiture as a result of different vesting provisions. Under the restricted stock plan, vested shares are considered issued and outstanding. Employees with restricted stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights on non-forfeited shares.
Prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically repurchased shares from employees within six months of the shares vesting. As such, for the periods prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s initial public offering, the restricted stock awards were accounted for as liability-classified awards. In the periods subsequent to the initial public offering, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. discontinued repurchasing employee held restricted shares due to the existence of a public market for the shares. Accordingly, upon the initial public offering ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has modified the restricted stock awards from being accounted for as liability-classified to equity-classified awards and reclassified the carrying amount of the awards of $4.8 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock has been accounted for as equity-classified awards for the periods subsequent to the initial public offering. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s common stock. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee#8217;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March#160;31, 2017.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects all restricted stock grants to vest.
At March#160;31, 2017, there was approximately $3.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock that will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of 2.4 years. During the fiscal year ended March#160;31, 2017, the weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock granted was $24.20. No restricted stock was granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. During the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the total fair value of restricted stock that vested was $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan
On June#160;18, 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amended its then-existing Stockholders#8217; Agreement to authorize 0.3 million shares of restricted stock to be granted to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The shares typically will vest one year from the date of issuance. Under this stock plan, the vested shares granted are considered issued and outstanding. Non-employee directors with this stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights. #160;#160;#160;#160;
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has determined that the restricted stock granted to directors should be accounted for as equity-classified awards. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million and 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March#160;31, 2017 and 2016.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s effective tax rate will vary based on factors, including but not limited to, overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before taxes and discrete events.#160;The fiscal 2015 effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate due in part to the significant permanent differences associated with non-deductible ESOP stock appreciation and stock-based compensation expense, the effect of which was increased by the near break-even amount of pre-tax income, whereas the fiscal year 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates more closely approximate a normal effective tax rate for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC..

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on approximately $28.0 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries at March#160;31, 2017 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely with the exception of cash dividends paid by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ADS Mexicana joint venture. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.
Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions
As of March#160;31, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had unrecognized tax benefit of $6.2 million, which if resolved favorably, would reduce income tax expense by $6.2 million.

It is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to activities of the IRS or other taxing authorities, including proposed assessments of additional tax, possible settlement of audit issues, or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2014 through March#160;31, 2017.

NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the Net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period.
Holders of unvested restricted stock have non-forfeitable rights to dividends when declared on common stock, and holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock participate in dividends on an as-converted basis when declared on common stock. As a result, unvested restricted stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock meet the definition of participating securities, which requires us to apply the two-class method to compute both basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders.
The dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the diluted two-class method. In computing diluted net income per share, income available to common stockholders used in the basic net income per share calculation (numerator) is adjusted, subject to sequencing rules, for certain adjustments that would result from the assumed issuance of potential common shares. Diluted net income per share assumes the redeemable convertible preferred stock would be cash settled through the effective date of the IPO on July#160;25, 2014, as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has the choice of settling in cash or shares and it has demonstrated past practice and intent of cash settlement. Therefore these shares are excluded from the calculation through the effective date of the IPO. After the effective date of the IPO, management#8217;s intent is to share settle; therefore, these shares are included in the calculation from July#160;26, 2014 through March#160;31, 2017, if dilutive. For purposes of the calculation of diluted net income per share, stock options and unvested restricted stock are considered to be potential common stock and are only included in the calculations when their effect is dilutive.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s redeemable common stock is included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted net income per share.
The following table presents information necessary to calculate net income (loss) per share for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., its wholly owned subsidiaries, its majority owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (#8220;VIEs#8221;) of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments where it exercises significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are recorded in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related equity in earnings from these investments are included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
  
Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (#8220;GAAP#8221;) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, determination of the proper accounting for leases, valuation of equity method investments, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment, accounting for stock-based compensation and the ESOP, valuation of the redeemable common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, determination of allowances for sales returns, rebates and discounts, determination of the valuation allowance, if any, on deferred tax assets, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Management#8217;s estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and available information. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
  
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Receivables include trade receivables, refundable income taxes and other miscellaneous receivables, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables at March#160;31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is generally not required. The evaluation of the customer#8217;s financial condition is performed to reduce the risk of loss. Accounts receivable are evaluated for collectability based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment. This estimate is periodically adjusted when management becomes aware of a specific customer#8217;s inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in historical collection patterns.
  
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out (#8220;FIFO#8221;) method. Costs include the cost of acquiring materials, including in-bound freight from vendors and freight incurred for the transportation of raw materials, tooling or finished goods between ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s manufacturing plants and its distribution centers, direct and indirect labor, factory overhead and certain corporate overhead costs related to the production of inventory. The portion of fixed manufacturing overhead that relates to capacity in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s normal capacity is expensed in the period in which it is incurred and is not included in inventory. Market value of inventory is established based on the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence, and other factors. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and adjustments are made whenever necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.
  
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Method - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired through acquisitions, which are initially recorded at fair value. Equipment acquired under capital lease is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term, if shorter, as follows:
#160;
Years
Buildings
40 #8212; 45
Machinery and equipment
3 #8212; 18
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or life of lease
#160;
Costs of additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the asset accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Construction in progress is also recorded at cost and includes capitalized interest, capitalized payroll costs and related costs such as taxes and other fringe benefits. Interest capitalized was $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
  
Goodwill - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment as of March#160;31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is comprised of two steps. The first step requires the comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its respective carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit#8217;s goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit#8217;s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. With respect to this testing, a reporting unit is a component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. The fair value estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. For the fiscal 2017, ADS completed a quantitative fair value assessment of the International reporting unit and determined no impairment charge was required. 
GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of the Domestic reporting unit in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the Domestic reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed. ADS applied the qualitative assessment to the Domestic reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for goodwill in the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
  
Intangible Assets#160;#8212; Definite-Lived- Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the asset group may not be recoverable. Asset groups are established primarily by determining the lowest level of cash flows available. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of such assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
  
Intangible Assets#160;#8212; Indefinite-Lived- Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of March#160;31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. To estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses an income approach, which utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
GAAP allows entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets for the impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible assets unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of indefinite-lived trademarks in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trademarks substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed.
ADS applied the qualitative assessment to specific trademarks for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the trademarks fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for Intangible assets in the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
  
Other Assets - Other assets include investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, cash surrender value of officer life insurance on key senior management executives, capitalized software development costs, deposits, Central parts, and other miscellaneous assets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. capitalizes development costs for internal use software. Capitalization of software development costs begins in the application development stage and ends when the asset is placed into service. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amortizes such costs using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 2 to 10 years, which is included in General and administrative expense, Selling expense or Cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the nature of the asset and its intended use. Central parts represent spare production equipment items which are used to replace worn or broken production equipment parts and help reduce the risk of prolonged equipment outages. The cost of Central parts is amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of 8 to 30 years.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable, and recognizes an impairment loss when a decline in value below carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary. Under these circumstances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value, which then becomes its new carrying value. For the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Leases - Leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and assumes the initial lease term includes cancellable and renewal periods that are reasonably assured. For leases classified as capital leases at lease inception, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records a capital lease asset and lease financing obligation equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset. The capital lease asset is recorded in Property, plant and equipment, net and amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term using the straight-line method, and the lease financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method over the lease term with the rental payments being allocated to principal and interest.

Stock Options
Liability-Classified Options #8211; Prior to fiscal 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability associated with the exercise of the stock options through the net settlement of shares in excess of the minimum tax withholding required by law. In addition, prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had periodically repurchased shares resulting from option exercises within six months of the exercise date. As such, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for all 2000 Plan and 2013 Plan awards issued prior to fiscal 2017 as liability-classified awards.
Liability-classified stock option awards are re-measured at fair value at each relevant reporting date, and the pro-rata vested portion of the award is recognized as a liability. The stock-based compensation liability associated with stock options expected to vest within the next twelve months is recorded in Current portion of liability-classified stock-based awards, with the portion related to those expected to vest beyond twelve months recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When stock options are exercised, the liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital at fair value. The proceeds from the exercise are also recorded as additional paid in capital.
Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee#8217;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. For liability-classified options, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the end of each period. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of liability-classified stock options:

As of March#160;31, 2017, there was a total of $3.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards under the 2013 Plan that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 1.1 years.
The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and currently exercisable as of March#160;31, 2017 was $14.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $3.4 million, $3.6 million, and $7.2 million, respectively.

Equity-Classified Options - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for awards under the 2013 Plan granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as equity-classified awards as employees are no longer permitted to satisfy their personal tax liability in excess of the minimum statutory withholding. Equity-classified stock option awards are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value of each award. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee#8217;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines the fair value of the options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date. This methodology requires significant inputs including the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s common stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and expiration date.

As of March 31, 2017, there was a total of $2.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity-classified stock option awards that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 2.9 years. The weighted average grant fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $7.81, $0.00, and $0.00, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million, respectively. There were no options exercised during the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Restricted Stock 
On September#160;16, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the restricted stock plan, which provides for the issuance of restricted stock awards to certain key employees. The restricted stock generally vest ratably over a five-year period from the original restricted stock grant date, contingent on the employee#8217;s continuous employment by ADS. In certain instances, however, a portion of the grants vested immediately or for accounting purposes were deemed to have vested immediately, including the grants to the Chief Executive Officer, which do not have a substantial risk of forfeiture as a result of different vesting provisions. Under the restricted stock plan, vested shares are considered issued and outstanding. Employees with restricted stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights on non-forfeited shares.
Prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically repurchased shares from employees within six months of the shares vesting. As such, for the periods prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s initial public offering, the restricted stock awards were accounted for as liability-classified awards. In the periods subsequent to the initial public offering, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. discontinued repurchasing employee held restricted shares due to the existence of a public market for the shares. Accordingly, upon the initial public offering ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has modified the restricted stock awards from being accounted for as liability-classified to equity-classified awards and reclassified the carrying amount of the awards of $4.8 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock has been accounted for as equity-classified awards for the periods subsequent to the initial public offering. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s common stock. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employee#8217;s requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March#160;31, 2017.

Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan
On June#160;18, 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amended its then-existing Stockholders#8217; Agreement to authorize 0.3 million shares of restricted stock to be granted to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The shares typically will vest one year from the date of issuance. Under this stock plan, the vested shares granted are considered issued and outstanding. Non-employee directors with this stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights. #160;#160;#160;#160;
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has determined that the restricted stock granted to directors should be accounted for as equity-classified awards. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million and 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March#160;31, 2017 and 2016.

The total advertising costs were $3.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
  
Self-Insurance - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for short term disability and medical coverage it provides for substantially all eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for medical claims up to the individual and aggregate stop-loss coverage limits. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues for claims incurred but not reported based on an estimate of future claims related to events that occurred prior to the fiscal year end if it has not met the aggregate stop-loss coverage limit. Amounts expensed totaled $39.5 million, $37.5 million, and $32.0 million for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of which employees contributed $5.1 million, $4.5 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for various other general insurance programs to the extent of the applicable deductible limits on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s insurance coverage. These programs include primarily automobile, general liability and employment practices coverage with deductibles ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million per occurrence or claim incurred. Amounts expensed during the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported at year end, were $1.8 million, $2.1 million, and $0.6 million, for the years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for workers#8217; compensation insurance with stop-loss coverage for claims that exceed $0.3 million per incident up to the respective state statutory limits. Amounts expensed, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported, were $2.1 million, $3.9 million, and $1.4 million for the fiscal years ended March#160;31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
  
Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and represent the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. They are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Penalties and interest recorded on income taxes payable are recorded as part of Income tax expense.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process, based upon the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
  
Fair Values -The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level#160;1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level#160;3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level#160;1#160;#8212; Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level#160;2#160;#8212; Observable inputs other than those included in Level#160;1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level#160;3#160;#8212; Unobservable inputs reflecting management#8217;s own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
ADS#8217;s policy for determining when transfers between levels have occurred is to use the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
  
Concentrations of Risk - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a large, active customer base of approximately twenty thousand customers with two customers, Ferguson Enterprises and HD Supply Waterworks, each representing more than 10% of annual net sales. Such customers accounted for 23.5%, 21.1%, and 20.3% of fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 net sales, respectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s customer base is diversified across the range of end markets that it serves.
Financial instruments that potentially subject ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of Receivables. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. provides its products to customers based on an evaluation of the customers#8217; financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on Receivables is principally dependent on each customer#8217;s financial condition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. monitors the exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to Receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographies. One customer, Ferguson Enterprises, accounted for approximately 15.7% and 14.0% of Receivables at March#160;31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
  
Derivatives - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. ADS uses interest rate swaps, commodity options in the form of collars and swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage various exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore, gains and losses from contract settlements and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in Derivative losses (gains) and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also has forward purchase agreements in place with certain resin suppliers for virgin polyethylene resin. The agreements specify a fixed amount of virgin resin material to be purchased at a fixed price for a given period of time in quantities ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will use in the normal course of business, and therefore, are not subject to the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (#8220;ASC#8221;) 810-15nbsp;nbsp;Consolidation. The cost of such resin is recognized in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
  
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Consolidation #8212; In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (#8220;FASB#8221;) issued an accounting standards update to make changes to consolidation guidance to address concerns of stakeholders that current accounting for certain legal entities might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entity#8217;s contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entity#8217;s voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entity#8217;s economic benefits or obligations. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December#160;15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April#160;1, 2016. The update has had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs #8212; In April 2015, the FASB issued#160;an accounting standards update that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that provided supplemental guidance that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December#160;15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April#160;1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. See Note 12. Debt for additional information about the impact of the adoption of the updates.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities #8212; In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, as non-current, rather than separately record the current and non-current portions. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December#160;15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted. The impact of the adoption of this standard was a reduction to the net current deferred tax assets balance included in Deferred income taxes and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to zero as of March 31, 2017, with all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2017 now being classified as non-current. The update had no effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.#8217;s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders#8217; Equity and Mezzanine Equity.
Internal-Use Software #8211; In April 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance to customers concerning whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. Under this new standard, 1) if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses, or 2) if the arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted the new standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Revenue Recognition #8212; In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. The amendment sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities to periods beginning after December#160;15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date of periods beginning after December#160;15, 2016. There have also been various additional accounting standards updates issued by the FASB in 2016 that further amend this new revenue standard. The updated standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
Measurement of Inventory #8212; In July 2015, the FASB issued#160;an accounting standards update which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, simplifying current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The determination of market value, under current guidance, is considered unnecessarily complex as there are several potential outcomes based on its definition as replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. Whereas net realizable value, under the update, is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December#160;15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Leases #8212; In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for leases. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize most leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease that has an accounting lease term of twelve months or less. The amendment also contains other changes to the current lease guidance that may result in changes to how entities determine which contractual arrangements qualify as a lease, the accounting for executory costs such as property taxes and insurance, as well as which lease origination costs will be capitalizable. The new standard also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. The updated standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the new guidance will be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements of the period of adoption. The modified retrospective transition approach includes certain practical expedients that entities may elect to apply in transition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2019. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet determined whether to apply any of the available practical expedients. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has begun the process of reviewing contracts under the new standard to determine the impact the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is also in process of implementing a new software solution to improve the process of accounting for leases under the current and new standard.
Stock-Based Compensation #8212; In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will adopt the standard on April 1, 2017. This update contains changes to the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby excess tax benefits will be recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. This standard is expected to result in increased volatility to the income tax expense in future periods dependent upon the timing of employee exercises of stock options, the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock and the vesting of restricted stock awards. Excess tax benefits will now be classified as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows.
The amendment also contains potential changes to the accounting for forfeitures, whereby entities can elect to either continue to apply the current GAAP requirement to estimate forfeitures when determining compensation expense, or to alternatively reverse the compensation expense of forfeited awards when they occur. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will account for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in expense volatility based on the timing of forfeitures.
In addition, the amendment also modifies the net-share settlement liability classification exception for statutory income tax withholdings, whereby the new guidance allows an employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation to withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory tax rate in the employee#8217;s applicable jurisdiction. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. included this provision in awards issued in fiscal 2017 and modified previously issued awards on April 1, 2017. See the note regarding Subsequent Events for further information on the modification.
Measurement of Credit Losses #8212; In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables. This accounting standards update requires the use of an impairment model referred to as the current expected credit loss model. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flow Classification #8212; In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance and distributions received from equity method investees. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December#160;15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. This amended guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Definition of a Business#160;#8211; In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to clarify the definition of a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.#160;The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December#160;15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April#160;1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill Impairment#160;#8211; In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the standards update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit#8217;s fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April 1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of pronouncements described above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements.

- DefinitionThe number of securities classified as temporary equity that have been issued and are held by the entity's shareholders. Securities outstanding equals securities issued minus securities held in treasury. Temporary equity is a security with redemption features that are outside the control of the issuer, is not classified as an asset or liability in conformity with GAAP, and is not mandatorily redeemable. Includes any type of security that is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price or on a fixed or determinable date or dates, is redeemable at the option of the holder, or has conditions for redemption which are not solely within the control of the issuer. If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.

BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business - Advanced Drainage Systems,Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ADS and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.), incorporated in Delaware, designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products, primarily in North and South America and Europe. ADSs broad product line includes corrugated high density polyethylene (or HDPE) pipe, polypropylene (or PP) pipe and related water management products.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s fiscal year begins on April1 and ends on March31. Unless otherwise noted, references to year pertain to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s fiscal year. For example, 2017 refers to fiscal 2017, which is the period from April1, 2016 to March31, 2017.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is managed based primarily on the geographies in which it operates and reports results of operations in two reportable segments. The reportable segments are Domestic and International.
2014 Initial Public Offering (IPO) - On July11, 2014, in anticipation of the IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. executed a 4.707-for-one split of its common and its preferred stock. The effect of the stock split on outstanding shares and earnings per share has been retroactively applied to all prior periods presented.
On July25, 2014, ADS completed the IPO of its common stock, which resulted in the sale by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. of 5.3 million shares of common stock. ADS received total proceeds from the IPO of $79.1 million after excluding underwriter discounts and commissions of $5.5 million, based upon the price to the public of $16.00 per share. After deducting other offering expenses of $6.9 million, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used the net proceeds of $72.2 million to reduce the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving portion of its credit facility. The common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WMS.
On August22, 2014, an additional 0.6 million shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. as a result of the partial exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholders to the underwriters in connection with the IPO. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $16.00 per share. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares.
2014 Secondary Public Offering (Secondary Public Offering) - On December9, 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. completed a Secondary Public Offering of common stock, which resulted in the sale of 10.0 million shares of common stock by a certain selling stockholder of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at a public offering price of $21.25 per share. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder.
On December15, 2014, an additional 1.5 million shares of common stock were sold by a certain selling stockholder of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. as a result of the full exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option granted by the selling stockholder to the underwriters in connection with the Secondary Public Offering. The shares were sold at the public offering price of $21.25 per share. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such additional shares.
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., its wholly owned subsidiaries, its majority owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments where it exercises significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are recorded in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related equity in earnings from these investments are included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, determination of the proper accounting for leases, valuation of equity method investments, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment, accounting for stock-based compensation and the ESOP, valuation of the redeemable common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, determination of allowances for sales returns, rebates and discounts, determination of the valuation allowance, if any, on deferred tax assets, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Managements estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and available information. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Receivables include trade receivables, refundable income taxes and other miscellaneous receivables, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables at March31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is generally not required. The evaluation of the customers financial condition is performed to reduce the risk of loss. Accounts receivable are evaluated for collectability based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment. This estimate is periodically adjusted when management becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in historical collection patterns.
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Costs include the cost of acquiring materials, including in-bound freight from vendors and freight incurred for the transportation of raw materials, tooling or finished goods between ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s manufacturing plants and its distribution centers, direct and indirect labor, factory overhead and certain corporate overhead costs related to the production of inventory. The portion of fixed manufacturing overhead that relates to capacity in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s normal capacity is expensed in the period in which it is incurred and is not included in inventory. Market value of inventory is established based on the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence, and other factors. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and adjustments are made whenever necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Method - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired through acquisitions, which are initially recorded at fair value. Equipment acquired under capital lease is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term, if shorter, as follows:
Years
Buildings
40  45
Machinery and equipment
3  18
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or life of lease
Costs of additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the asset accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Construction in progress is also recorded at cost and includes capitalized interest, capitalized payroll costs and related costs such as taxes and other fringe benefits. Interest capitalized was $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Goodwill - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is comprised of two steps. The first step requires the comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its respective carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. With respect to this testing, a reporting unit is a component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. The fair value estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. For the fiscal 2017, ADS completed a quantitative fair value assessment of the International reporting unit and determined no impairment charge was required. 
GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of the Domestic reporting unit in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the Domestic reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed. ADS applied the qualitative assessment to the Domestic reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for goodwill in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Intangible Assets
Intangible Assets Definite-Lived- Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the asset group may not be recoverable. Asset groups are established primarily by determining the lowest level of cash flows available. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of such assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Intangible Assets Indefinite-Lived- Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. To estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses an income approach, which utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
GAAP allows entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets for the impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible assets unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of indefinite-lived trademarks in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trademarks substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed.
ADS applied the qualitative assessment to specific trademarks for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the trademarks fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for Intangible assets in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Other Assets - Other assets include investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, cash surrender value of officer life insurance on key senior management executives, capitalized software development costs, deposits, Central parts, and other miscellaneous assets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. capitalizes development costs for internal use software. Capitalization of software development costs begins in the application development stage and ends when the asset is placed into service. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amortizes such costs using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 2 to 10 years, which is included in General and administrative expense, Selling expense or Cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the nature of the asset and its intended use. Central parts represent spare production equipment items which are used to replace worn or broken production equipment parts and help reduce the risk of prolonged equipment outages. The cost of Central parts is amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of 8 to 30 years.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable, and recognizes an impairment loss when a decline in value below carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary. Under these circumstances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value, which then becomes its new carrying value. For the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Leases - Leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and assumes the initial lease term includes cancellable and renewal periods that are reasonably assured. For leases classified as capital leases at lease inception, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records a capital lease asset and lease financing obligation equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset. The capital lease asset is recorded in Property, plant and equipment, net and amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term using the straight-line method, and the lease financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method over the lease term with the rental payments being allocated to principal and interest. For leases classified as operating leases, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records rent expense over the lease term using the straight-line method.
Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated at a monthly average exchange rate and equity transactions are translated using either the actual exchange rate on the day of the transaction or a monthly average historical exchange rate. For the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) consisted entirely of foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Net Sales - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. sells pipe products and related water management products. ADS ships products to customers predominantly by internal fleet and to a lesser extent by third-party carriers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not provide any additional revenue generating services after product delivery.
Sales, net of sales tax and allowances for returns, rebates and discounts are recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. ADS recognizes revenue when both persuasive evidence of an arrangement and the price is fixed or determinable. Title to the products and risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon delivery. ADS performs credit check procedures on all new customers, establishes credit limits accordingly, and monitors the creditworthiness of existing customers, which is the basis for concluding that collectability is reasonably assured.
Shipping Costs - Shipping costs are incurred to physically move raw materials, tooling and products between manufacturing and distribution facilities and from production or distribution facilities to customers. Shipping costs for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $120.4 million, $120.5 million, and $121.0 million, respectively, and are included in Cost of goods sold. In certain instances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bills shipping costs to customers. Shipping costs billed to customers were $5.5 million, $7.0 million, and $9.3 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in Net sales.
Stock-Based Compensation - See Note18. Stock-Based Compensation for information about ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock-based compensation award programs and related accounting policies.
Advertising - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are recorded in Selling expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total advertising costs were $3.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Self-Insurance - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for short term disability and medical coverage it provides for substantially all eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for medical claims up to the individual and aggregate stop-loss coverage limits. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues for claims incurred but not reported based on an estimate of future claims related to events that occurred prior to the fiscal year end if it has not met the aggregate stop-loss coverage limit. Amounts expensed totaled $39.5 million, $37.5 million, and $32.0 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of which employees contributed $5.1 million, $4.5 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for various other general insurance programs to the extent of the applicable deductible limits on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s insurance coverage. These programs include primarily automobile, general liability and employment practices coverage with deductibles ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million per occurrence or claim incurred. Amounts expensed during the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported at year end, were $1.8 million, $2.1 million, and $0.6 million, for the years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for workers compensation insurance with stop-loss coverage for claims that exceed $0.3 million per incident up to the respective state statutory limits. Amounts expensed, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported, were $2.1 million, $3.9 million, and $1.4 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and represent the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. They are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Penalties and interest recorded on income taxes payable are recorded as part of Income tax expense.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process, based upon the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
Fair Values -The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level2 Observable inputs other than those included in Level1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level3 Unobservable inputs reflecting managements own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
ADSs policy for determining when transfers between levels have occurred is to use the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Concentrations of Risk - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a large, active customer base of approximately twenty thousand customers with two customers, Ferguson Enterprises and HD Supply Waterworks, each representing more than 10% of annual net sales. Such customers accounted for 23.5%, 21.1%, and 20.3% of fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 net sales, respectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s customer base is diversified across the range of end markets that it serves.
Financial instruments that potentially subject ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of Receivables. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. provides its products to customers based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on Receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. monitors the exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to Receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographies. One customer, Ferguson Enterprises, accounted for approximately 15.7% and 14.0% of Receivables at March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Derivatives - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. ADS uses interest rate swaps, commodity options in the form of collars and swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage various exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore, gains and losses from contract settlements and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in Derivative losses (gains) and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also has forward purchase agreements in place with certain resin suppliers for virgin polyethylene resin. The agreements specify a fixed amount of virgin resin material to be purchased at a fixed price for a given period of time in quantities ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will use in the normal course of business, and therefore, are not subject to the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810-15Consolidation. The cost of such resin is recognized in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Consolidation  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update to make changes to consolidation guidance to address concerns of stakeholders that current accounting for certain legal entities might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entitys contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entitys voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entitys economic benefits or obligations. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April1, 2016. The update has had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs  In April 2015, the FASB issuedan accounting standards update that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that provided supplemental guidance that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. See Note 12. Debt for additional information about the impact of the adoption of the updates.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities  In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, as non-current, rather than separately record the current and non-current portions. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted. The impact of the adoption of this standard was a reduction to the net current deferred tax assets balance included in Deferred income taxes and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to zero as of March 31, 2017, with all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2017 now being classified as non-current. The update had no effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Mezzanine Equity.
Internal-Use Software  In April 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance to customers concerning whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. Under this new standard, 1) if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses, or 2) if the arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted the new standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. The amendment sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities to periods beginning after December15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date of periods beginning after December15, 2016. There have also been various additional accounting standards updates issued by the FASB in 2016 that further amend this new revenue standard. The updated standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
Measurement of Inventory  In July 2015, the FASB issuedan accounting standards update which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, simplifying current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The determination of market value, under current guidance, is considered unnecessarily complex as there are several potential outcomes based on its definition as replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. Whereas net realizable value, under the update, is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for leases. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize most leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease that has an accounting lease term of twelve months or less. The amendment also contains other changes to the current lease guidance that may result in changes to how entities determine which contractual arrangements qualify as a lease, the accounting for executory costs such as property taxes and insurance, as well as which lease origination costs will be capitalizable. The new standard also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. The updated standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the new guidance will be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements of the period of adoption. The modified retrospective transition approach includes certain practical expedients that entities may elect to apply in transition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2019. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet determined whether to apply any of the available practical expedients. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has begun the process of reviewing contracts under the new standard to determine the impact the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is also in process of implementing a new software solution to improve the process of accounting for leases under the current and new standard.
Stock-Based Compensation  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will adopt the standard on April 1, 2017. This update contains changes to the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby excess tax benefits will be recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. This standard is expected to result in increased volatility to the income tax expense in future periods dependent upon the timing of employee exercises of stock options, the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock and the vesting of restricted stock awards. Excess tax benefits will now be classified as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows.
The amendment also contains potential changes to the accounting for forfeitures, whereby entities can elect to either continue to apply the current GAAP requirement to estimate forfeitures when determining compensation expense, or to alternatively reverse the compensation expense of forfeited awards when they occur. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will account for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in expense volatility based on the timing of forfeitures.
In addition, the amendment also modifies the net-share settlement liability classification exception for statutory income tax withholdings, whereby the new guidance allows an employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation to withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory tax rate in the employees applicable jurisdiction. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. included this provision in awards issued in fiscal 2017 and modified previously issued awards on April 1, 2017. See the note regarding Subsequent Events for further information on the modification.
Measurement of Credit Losses  In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables. This accounting standards update requires the use of an impairment model referred to as the current expected credit loss model. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flow Classification  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance and distributions received from equity method investees. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. This amended guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Definition of a Business In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to clarify the definition of a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the standards update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April 1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of pronouncements described above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements.

ACQUISITIONS
Fiscal 2017 Acquisition of Plastic Tubing Industries
On February6, 2017, ADS acquired Plastic Tubing Industries (PTI), a manufacturer of HDPE pipe and related accessories. With the acquisition, ADS will increase its manufacturing footprint in Georgia and Texas, while adding production capacity to the existing ADS manufacturing facilities in Florida, to better serve growing demand in the region. The purchase price of PTI was $9.5 million, financed through the existing line of credit facility. At the time of acquisition, $8.5 million was paid in cash; the remaining $1.0 million will be paid on August 6, 2018. The results of operations of PTI are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations after February 6, 2017. The Net sales and Income before income taxes of PTI since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March31, 2017 were immaterial.
The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price. The difference was recognized as a gain on bargain purchase in fiscal 2017. The purchase price allocation is as follows:

The acquired identifiable intangible assets represent trade name of $0.2 million (seven-year useful life). The following table contains unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations information assuming the acquisition occurred on April1, 2015 and includes adjustments for amortization of intangibles and depreciation of fixed asset. This unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of what actual results would have been if the acquisition had taken place on April1,2015 or of future results. In addition, the unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not projections of future results of operations of the combined company nor do they reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition.

Unaudited pro forma net income attributable to ADS for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016 has been calculated after adjusting the combined results of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to reflect additional intangible asset amortization expense, net of related income taxes, of less than $0.1 million, and depreciation expense, net of related income taxes, of $0.6 million.
Fiscal 2016 Step Acquisition of BaySaver
On July17, 2015, ADS Ventures, Inc. (ADS/V), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySaver, increasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s total ownership interest in BaySaver to 65%, for a purchase price of $3.2 million, plus contingent consideration with an initial estimated fair value of $0.8 million. Concurrent with the purchase of the additional membership investment, the BaySaver joint venture agreement was amended to modify the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for this transaction as a business combination with BaySaver being consolidated into the financial statements after July17, 2015.
As ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for the investment in BaySaver prior to the purchase of the 10% additional membership interest under the equity method of accounting, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounted for this business combination as a step acquisition and recognized a loss of $0.5 million on remeasurement to fair value of the previously held investment. The loss is included in Derivative losses and other expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s BaySaver investment immediately before the July17, 2015 acquisition was measured based on a combination of the discounted cash flow and guideline public company valuation methods and involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). These inputs include projected sales, margin, required rate of return and tax rate for the discounted cash flow method, as well as implied pricing multiples, and guideline public company group for the guideline public company method.
The purchase price was determined as follows:
 (Amounts in thousands)
Acquisition-date fair value of prior equity interest
$
4,220
Acquisition-date fair value of noncontrolling interest
6,330
Cash paid at acquisition date
3,200
Fair value of contingent consideration
750
Total purchase price
$
14,500
The purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets, assumed liabilities and goodwill. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets has been determined primarily using the income approach, which involves significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 inputs). These inputs include projected sales, margin, required rate of return and tax rate, as well as an estimated royalty rate in the cases of the developed technology and trade name and trademark intangibles. The developed technology and trade name and trademark intangibles are valued using a relief-from-royalty method.
Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries is classified as mezzanine equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to a put option held by the joint venture partner, which may be exercised on or after April1, 2017. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance will be accreted to the estimated redemption value using the effective interest method until April1, 2017.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $2.5 million was allocated to goodwill, assigned to the Domestic segment, and consists primarily of the acquired workforce and sales and cost synergies the two companies anticipate realizing as a combined company. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

The acquired identifiable intangible assets represent customer relationships of $5.4 million, developed technology of $4.0 million and trade name and trademark of $1.4 million, each of which have an estimated 10-year useful life. Transaction costs were immaterial.
The net sales and income before income taxes of BaySaver since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 were $10.2 million, and $1.2 million, respectively.
The following table contains unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations information assuming the acquisition occurred on April1, 2014 and includes adjustments for amortization of intangibles, interest expense and the prior equity method accounting for BaySaver. This unaudited pro forma information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not indicative of what actual results would have been if the acquisition had taken place on April1, 2014 or of future results. The unaudited pro forma consolidated results are not projections of future results of operations of the combined company nor do they reflect the expected realization of any cost savings or synergies associated with the acquisition.

Ideal Pipe designs, manufactures and markets high performance thermoplastic corrugated pipe and related water management products used across a broad range of Canadian end markets and applications, including nonresidential, residential, agriculture, and infrastructure applications. The acquisition further strengthens ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s position in Canada by increasing its size and scale in the market, as well as enhancing manufacturing, marketing and distribution capabilities. The purchase price of Ideal Pipe was $43.8 million, financed through cash acquired and the existing line of credit facility. The results of operations of Ideal Pipe are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations after January30, 2015. The Net sales and Income before income taxes of Ideal Pipe since the acquisition date included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 were immaterial.
The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired of $10.7 million was allocated to goodwill, assigned to the International segment, and consists primarily of the acquired workforce and synergies the two companies anticipate realizing as a combined company. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes. The purchase price allocation is as follows:

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used this currency hedge to fix the purchase price which was denominated in Canadian dollars from the agreement date until the transaction ultimately closed on January30, 2015.
The acquired identifiable intangible assets represent customer relationships of $4.9 million (seven-year useful life), trade name of $3.1 million (10-year useful life), and non-compete agreements of $0.3 million (three-year useful life). The following table contains unaudited pro forma Consolidated Statements of Operations information assuming the acquisition occurred on April1, 2014 and includes adjustments for amortization of intangibles, depreciation of fixed assets and interest expense.

(b)
Amount necessary to reduce minimum lease payments to present value calculated at the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s incremental borrowing rate at lease inception.
Certain leases contain residual value guarantees that create a contingent obligation on the part of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to compensate the lessor if the leased asset cannot be sold for an amount in excess of a specified minimum value at the conclusion of the lease term. The calculation is based on the original cost of the transportation equipment, less lease payments made, compared to a percentage of the transportation equipments fair market value at the time of sale. All leased units covered by this guarantee have been classified as capital leases and a corresponding capital lease obligation was recorded. Therefore, no further contingent obligation is needed.
Operating leases - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. leases certain real estate and office equipment under various cancellable and non-cancellable operating lease agreements that expire at various dates through fiscal year 2037. 
Future minimum rental commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as of March31, 2017, are summarized below (amounts in thousands):

Fair Value Disclosures [Abstract]
Fair Value Measurement
8.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT
When applying fair value principles in the valuation of assets and liabilities, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is required to maximize the use of quoted market prices and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets or liabilities during the fiscal years presented. The fair value estimates take into consideration the credit risk of both ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. and its counterparties.
When active market quotes are not available for financial assets and liabilities, ADS uses industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including credit risk, interest rate curves, foreign currency rates and forward and spot prices for currencies. In circumstances where market-based observable inputs are not available, management judgment is used to develop assumptions to estimate fair value. Generally, the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Level3 instruments is estimated as the net present value of expected future cash flows based on internal and external inputs.
Recurring Fair Value Measurements

There were no transfers in or out of Levels 1, 2 and 3 for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016.
Valuation of Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions - The fair values of the contingent consideration payables for acquisitions were calculated based on a discounted cash flow model, whereby the probability-weighted future payment value is discounted to the present value using a market discount rate. The method used to price these liabilities is considered Level3, due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value.
Valuation of Redeemable Common Stock and Executive Stock Repurchase Agreements Obligations - The redemption feature of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s redeemable common stock allowing the holder to put its shares to ADS for cash, as discussed in the previous paragraph, became unenforceable upon effectiveness of the IPO on July25, 2014. As a result, the redeemable common stock was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders equity. See Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information on the IPO.
The liability associated with the executive stock repurchase agreements was valued on the same basis as the redeemable common stock, and as such is also considered a Level3 measurement.The executive stock repurchase agreements were terminated upon the IPO.As a result, this liability was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders equity. See Note 16. Stockholders Equity for more information on the executive stock repurchase agreements.
Valuation of Debt - The carrying amounts of current financial assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the immediate or short-term maturity of these items, or in the case of derivative instruments, because they are recorded at fair value. The carrying and fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Senior Notes (discussed in Note 12. Debt) were $75.0 million and $75.9 million, respectively, as of March 31, 2017 and $100.0 million and $101.2 million, respectively, at March 31, 2016. The fair value of the Senior Notes was determined based on a comparison of the interest rate and terms of such borrowings to the rates and terms of similar debt available for the period. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. believes the carrying amount on the remaining long-term debt, including the Secured Bank Term Loans, is not materially different from its fair value as the interest rates and terms of the borrowings are similar to currently available borrowings. The categorization of the framework used to evaluate this debt is considered Level 2.
Non-recurring Fair Value Measurements
Valuation of Investment in the South American Joint Venture - During the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture equal to the difference between the fair value of the investment and the carrying value. The method used to value the investment is considered Level3 due to the subjective nature of the unobservable inputs used to determine the fair value. In the determination of fair value of its investment, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. used a weighted income approach, based on internal forecasts of expected future cash flows, and market approach, based on comparable public companies. Significant unobservable inputs included the WACC used to discount the future cash flows, which were between 9.3% and 16.5%, based on the markets in which the South American Joint Venture conducts business. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

BaySaver - BaySaver was established in July 2013 to design, engineer, manufacture, market and sell water quality filters and separators used in the removal of sediment and pollution from storm water anywhere in the world except New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s original investment represented a 55% equity interest and a 50% voting interest in BaySaver. On July17, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the BaySaver joint venture. Concurrent with the additional investment in July 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also entered into an amendment to the BaySaver joint venture agreement to change the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest.

INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. participates in two unconsolidated joint ventures, South American Joint Venture, which is 50% owned by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s wholly-owned subsidiary ADS Chile, and Tigre-ADS USA, Inc. (Tigre-ADS USA), which is 49% owned by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s wholly-owned subsidiary ADS Ventures, Inc. In each case, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has concluded that it is appropriate to account for these investments using the equity method, whereby ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s share of the income or loss of the joint venture is reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under Equity in net loss (income) of unconsolidated affiliates and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s investment in the joint venture is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
South American Joint Venture - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s investment in this unconsolidated joint venture was formed for the purpose of expanding upon the growth of manufacturing and selling HDPE corrugated pipe in the South American market via the joint venture partners local presence and expertise throughout the region. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not required to consolidate the South American Joint Venture as it is not the primary beneficiary, although ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does hold a significant variable interest in the South American Joint Venture through the equity investment and debt guarantee.

During the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determined there was an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value of its investment in the South American Joint Venture, resulting from a further decline of unfavorable regional economic conditions. Accordingly, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, reducing the carrying value of the investment to its fair value. The impairment charge resulted in a basis difference between the cost of the investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of the South American Joint Venture of $4.9 million and $4.0 million as of March 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively. The basis difference will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the underlying fixed assets, 9 years. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized $0.4 million and less than $0.1 million of amortization of the basis difference in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Tigre-ADS USA - On April7, 2014, ADS Ventures, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., and Tigre S.A.  Tubos e Conexoes entered into a stock purchase agreement to form a joint venture, Tigre-ADS USA.

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. acquired 49% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Tigre-ADS USA for $3.6 million. The joint venture represents a continuation of the existing activities of Tigre-ADS USA through its Janesville, Wisconsin manufacturing facility.

The Revolving Credit Facilities expire and the Term Note is due in June 2018. Principal payments of $2.5 million per quarter are due on the Term Note throughout the remaining term. The Revolving Credit Facilities and the Term Note have a variable interest rate that depends upon ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s pricing ratio as defined in the agreements for the Revolving Credit Facilities. The interest rate is derived from the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or alternate base rate (Prime Rate) at ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s option. The average rates were 2.61%, 2.70%, and 2.64% at March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The Secured Bank Term Loans are secured by a lien on a significant majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s assets. Letters of credit outstanding at March31, 2017 amounted to $10.6 million and reduce the availability of the Revolving Credit Facilities. The amount available for borrowing for ADS, Inc. and ADS Mexicana was $120.1 million and $10.5 million, respectively at March31, 2017. 
Senior Notes Payable - In December 2009, we signed an agreement with Prudential Investment Management,Inc. for the issuance of senior promissory notes (Senior Notes), for an aggregate amount of up to $100.0 million.

The rate is subject to an additional 200basis point excess leverage fee if the calculated leverage ratio exceeds 3 to 1 at the end of a fiscal quarter. A principal payment of $25.0 million was made in fiscal 2017 and additional payments are due in both fiscal 2018 and 2019.
In July 2013, ADS issued an additional $25.0 million of Senior Notes. Interest for the additional $25.0 million is payable quarterly and is fixed at 4.05%. The rate is subject to an additional 200 basis point excess leverage fee if calculated leverage ratio exceeds 3 to 1 at the end of a fiscal quarter. A principal payment of $25.0 million is due in September of fiscal year 2020.
Industrial Revenue Bonds - Between 1996 and 2007, ADS issued industrial revenue bonds for the construction of fADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s production facilities. Two of the bonds were retired during fiscal 2011 and one of the bonds was retired in fiscal 2015. The remaining bond requires quarterly principal payments until it matures in February 2019 and has a variable interest rate based on the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) municipal swap index rate which is computed weekly. The rate on this bond at March31, 2017, was 3.75%, including a letter of credit fee of 2.75%. Land and buildings with a net book value of approximately $9.4 million at March31, 2017, collateralize the bonds. These bonds are not considered auction rate securities.
ADS Mexicana Scotia Bank Revolving Credit Facility - On December11, 2014, ADSs joint venture, ADS Mexicana, entered into a credit agreement with Scotia Bank. The credit agreement provides for revolving loans up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $5.0 million. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility have primarily been used for short term investments and are available for working capital needs. The interest rates of the revolving credit facilities are determined by LIBOR rates, Tasa de Interes Interbancaria de Equilibrio (TIIE) or the Costos de Captacion rates, plus an applicable margin. The Scotia Bank revolving credit facility matures on December11, 2017. The obligations under the revolving credit facility are not guaranteed by ADS. As of March31, 2017, there was $1.0 million of outstanding principal drawn on the Scotia Bank revolving credit facility, which bears interest at the LIBOR, plus 1.60%. The outstanding principal drawn is due in May 2017.
On May27, 2016, ADS Mexicana obtained a waiver on a covenant from Scotia Bank relating to ADS Mexicana failing to notify Scotia Bank of changes in legal organizational structure and payment of dividends.

Litigation
On July29, 2015, a putative stockholder class action, Christopher Wyche, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Advanced Drainage Systems, Inc., et al. (Case No.1:15-cv-05955-KPF), was commenced in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the District Court), naming ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., along with Joseph A. Chlapaty, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Chief Executive Officer, and Mark B. Sturgeon, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s former Chief Financial Officer, as defendants and alleging violations of the federal securities laws. An amended complaint was filed on April28, 2016. The amended complaint alleges that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. made material misrepresentations and/or omissions of material fact in its public disclosures during the period from July25, 2014 through March29, 2016, in violation of Sections10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.

Subsequent to the initial voluntary production request, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. received document subpoenas from the Enforcement Division pursuant to a formal order of investigation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has from the outset cooperated with the Enforcement Divisions investigation and intends to continue to do so. While it is reasonably possible that this investigation ultimately could be resolved unfavorably to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently unable to estimate the range of possible losses, but they could be material.

Employee Benefit Plans

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. established the Advanced Drainage Systems,Inc. ESOP (the ESOP or the Plan) effective April1, 1993. The Plan was funded through a transfer of assets from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s tax-qualified profit-sharing retirement plan, as well as a 30-year term loan from ADS. The Plan operates as a tax-qualified leveraged ESOP and was designed to enable eligible employees to acquire stock ownership interest in ADS. Employees of ADS who have reached the age of 18 are generally eligible to participate in the Plan on March31 after sixmonths of service. Upon retirement, disability, death, or vested terminations, (i)a participant or designated beneficiary may elect to receive the amount in their account attributable to the 1993 transfer of assets from ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s tax-qualified profit sharing retirement plan in the form of cash or ADS stock with any fractional shares paid in cash; (ii)stock credited to the participants ESOP stock account resulting from the ESOPs loan repayments are distributed in the form of ADS stock, and (iii)amounts credited to the participants ESOP cash account are distributed in the form of cash. Upon attainment of age50 and sevenyears of participation in the Plan, a participant may elect to diversify specified percentages of the number of shares of ADS stock credited to the participants ESOP stock account in compliance with applicable law.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is obligated to make contributions to the Plan, which, when aggregated with the Plans dividends, equal the amount necessary to enable the Plan to make its regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest due on its term loan to ADS. As the Plan makes annual payments of principal and interest, an appropriate percentage of preferred stock is allocated to ESOP participants accounts in accordance with plan terms that are compliant with applicable Internal Revenue Code and regulatory provisions.
The carrying value of redeemable convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP trust, but not yet earned by the ESOP participants or used for dividends, is reported as Deferred compensation unearned ESOP shares within the mezzanine equity section of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Compensation expense and related dividends paid with ESOP shares are recognized based upon the average annual fair value of the shares allocated. The shares allocated are for services rendered throughout the period and, therefore, a simple average is used to calculate the average annual fair value. Deferred compensation unearned ESOP shares is relieved at fair value, with any difference between the annual average fair value and the carrying value of shares when allocated being added to Additional paid in capital. The fair value of the shares allocated was $16.80, $16.35, and $22.05 per share of redeemable convertible preferred stock at March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, resulting in an average annual fair value per share of $16.58, $19.20, and $16.61 per share for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. During the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized compensation expense of $9.6 million, $10.3 million, and $12.1 million, respectively, related to allocation of ESOP shares to participants.
Required dividends on allocated shares are generally passed through and paid in cash to the participants and required dividends on unallocated shares are paid in cash to the Plan and generally used to service the Plans debt.
In the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, the ESOP committee directed the Plan trustee to retain $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, in dividends on unallocated ADS shares rather than to service the Plans debt. These dividends were allocated to participants based on the total shares in their account in relation to total shares allocated at March31, 2017 and 2016.
In the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, 0.6 million and 0.5 million shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock, respectively, were allocated to the ESOP participants, including, in addition to the cash dividends, less than 0.1 million and less than 0.1 million preferred shares allocated as dividends, respectively. See Note 17. Mezzanine Equity for further details on the shares of Redeemable convertible preferred stock held by the ESOP.
Executive Termination Payments - ADS has employment agreements with certain executives that include potential payments to be made to those executives upon termination. The terms of the termination payments vary by executive, but are generally based on current base salary and bonus levels at the time of termination. The contractual termination payments vest upon either (1)certain contingent occurrences terminating employment such as death, disability, layoff, the executive voluntarily quitting due to a breach of covenants by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. or for other good reason or (2)the executive reaching a specified retirement age while still working for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., as defined in the individual employee agreement.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues a liability from the effective date of the executives employment agreement to the date the executive reaches the required retirement age while working for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., which is considered the service period for this obligation. The liability is estimated based on each executives current base salary and bonus levels. Because the executives vest in the termination payments equally over the relevant service period, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes the related compensation expense based on the straight-line method over the service period. If an executive terminates their employment prior to reaching the required retirement age, no payment is required and the previously-recorded compensation expense for that executive is reversed and recorded as a benefit to compensation expense in the period the executive terminates employment.
The compensation expense (benefit) recorded related to the executive termination payments for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.1 million, ($0.3) million and $0.3 million, respectively, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of March31, 2017 and 2016, the executive termination payment obligation was $5.1 million and $4.0 million, respectively, and is included in Other accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Profit-Sharing Plan - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a tax-qualified profit-sharing retirement plan with a 401(k) feature covering substantially all U.S. eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not make employer contributions to this plan in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a defined contribution postretirement benefit plan covering Canadian employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized costs of $0.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Stockholders' Equity

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY
During the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no purchases of common stock. During the fiscal year ended March31, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. purchased a negligible amount of fractional shares subsequent to the IPO at a price of $17.21 per share.
See Note 12. Debt for a description of restrictions on the payment of dividends imposed under the Secured Bank Term Loans and Senior Notes agreements.
Executive Stock Repurchase Agreements - In fiscal 2007, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. entered into stock repurchase agreements with certain executives, whereby ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. was required to repurchase shares of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock held by the executive at the current fair market value upon the executives death or certain events of termination, as defined. The amount of shares required to be repurchased by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. from the executive and which the executive or the executives heir or estate was obligated to sell to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., was limited to the anticipated proceeds from life insurance policies held by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. (referred to as a mandatorily redeemable obligation). In the case where shares were not repurchased due to the fair value of the shares exceeding the life insurance proceeds, the executive or the executives heir or estate had a put right up to a set dollar amount allowing the common stock to be put to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at the current fair market value (referred to as an executives put right). The stock repurchase agreements included termination clauses such that they would automatically terminate if a change in control event or an IPO occurred prior to the executives death.
Prior to the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified all shares subject to the mandatorily redeemable obligation as liabilities and all shares subject to an executives put rights as mezzanine equity. For those shares classified as liabilities, changes in the fair value of the shares were recognized as compensation expense. The related compensation expense for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 was $1.0 million, and is included in General and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For those shares classified as mezzanine equity, the balance was recorded in Redeemable common stock and changes in the fair value of the shares were recorded as adjustments to Retained deficit and Paid-in capital. The changes in fair value recorded as adjustments to Retained deficit was $(1.3) million for the fiscal year ended March31, 2015.
After the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. reclassified the carrying amount of the mandatorily redeemable obligation portion of the shares of $18.2 million and the executive put right portion of the shares of $1.5 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Mezzanine Equity
17.
MEZZANINE EQUITY
Redeemable Common Stock - Prior to the July 2014 IPO, one of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s minority equity owners along with other shareholders who hold ownership in ADS of at least 15% (referred to as Major Shareholders) entered into an agreement which provided the Major Shareholders the right to put their common stock to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. at fair value if, following the fifth anniversary of the recapitalization that occurred during 2010, a Major Shareholder demands that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. effect an IPO covering the registration of at least $50.0 million of securities, and either ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. advises the Major Shareholder that ADS will not begin preparations for an IPO within 180 days after delivery, or after such preparations have begun they are discontinued (the Major Shareholders Put Right). As the Major Shareholders Put Right was a redemption right which prior to the IPO was outside the control of ADS, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified common stock held by the Major Shareholders in the mezzanine equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets at its fair value, and changes in fair value were recorded in Retained earnings.
The redemption feature of the Redeemable common stock allowing the holder to put its shares to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for cash, as discussed in the previous paragraph, became unenforceable upon effectiveness of the IPO on July25, 2014. As a result, the Redeemable common stock was recorded at fair value through the effective date of the IPO and was subsequently reclassified at that fair value to stockholders equity. See Note 1. Background and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more information on the IPO. As a result of the IPO, there are 10.1 million shares of common stock held by Major Shareholders, which are now classified in stockholders equity.
In addition, stock repurchase agreements with certain executives provided the executive or the executives heir or estate with put rights up to a set dollar amount allowing their common stock to be put to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. Prior to the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO in July 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. classified all shares subject to the executives put rights as Redeemable common stock. After the termination of the stock repurchase agreements upon the IPO, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. reclassified the carrying amount of the shares subject to the executive put rights to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 16. Stockholders Equity for further discussion.
Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock - The Trustee of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s ESOP has the ability to put shares of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.. The Redeemable convertible preferred stock has a required cumulative 2.5% dividend (based on the issue price of $0.781 per share) and is convertible at a rate of 0.7692 shares of common stock for each share of Redeemable convertible preferred stock. ADS guarantees the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock at $0.781 per share. The put option requirements of the Internal Revenue Code apply in the event that ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock is not a registration type class of security or its trading has been restricted. Therefore, the holders of Redeemable convertible preferred stock have a put right to require ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to repurchase such shares in the event that the common stock is not listed for trading or otherwise quoted on the NYSE, AMEX, NASDAQ, or any other market more senior than the OTC Bulletin Board. As of March31, 2017, the applicable redemption value was $0.781 per share as there were no unpaid cumulative dividends.
Given that the event that may trigger redemption of the Redeemable convertible preferred stock (the listing or quotation on a market more senior than the OTC Bulletin Board) is not solely within ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s control, the redeemable convertible preferred stock is presented in the mezzanine equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
As of March31, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not adjust the carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock to its redemption value or recognize any changes in fair value as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not consider it probable that the Redeemable convertible preferred stock would become redeemable.
The Board of Directors approved the 2.5% annual dividend to be paid March31 of each fiscal year to the stockholders of record as of March15, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The annual dividend was paid in cash and stock on the allocated shares. During the first quarter of 2017, the Board of Directors approved the 2.5% annual dividend to be paid on March31, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March1, 2017.
Cash and stock dividends on allocated Redeemable convertible preferred stock for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are summarized in the following table. For additional information on dividends paid to the unallocated Redeemable convertible preferred stock, please refer to Note 15. Employee Benefit Plans.

Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries - On July17, 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. acquired an additional 10% of the issued and outstanding membership interests in BaySavers issued and outstanding membership interests, increasing ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s total ownership to 65%. Concurrent with ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s purchase of the additional membership investment, the BaySaver joint venture agreement was amended to change the voting rights from an equal vote for each member to a vote based upon the ownership interest. As a result, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has accounted for this transaction as a business combination and BaySaver is consolidated into ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s financial statements after July17, 2015.
The membership interests held by the joint venture partner are presented in Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, which is classified as mezzanine equity, due to a put option held by the joint venture partner which may be exercised on or after April1, 2017. The Redeemable noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries balance will be accreted to the redemption value using the effective interest method until April1, 2017. See Note 3. Acquisitions for further discussion of the BaySaver transaction.

Stock Options
Liability-Classified Options  Prior to fiscal 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability associated with the exercise of the stock options through the net settlement of shares in excess of the minimum tax withholding required by law. In addition, prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had periodically repurchased shares resulting from option exercises within six months of the exercise date. As such, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for all 2000 Plan and 2013 Plan awards issued prior to fiscal 2017 as liability-classified awards.
Liability-classified stock option awards are re-measured at fair value at each relevant reporting date, and the pro-rata vested portion of the award is recognized as a liability. The stock-based compensation liability associated with stock options expected to vest within the next twelve months is recorded in Current portion of liability-classified stock-based awards, with the portion related to those expected to vest beyond twelve months recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When stock options are exercised, the liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital at fair value. The proceeds from the exercise are also recorded as additional paid in capital.
Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. For liability-classified options, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the end of each period. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of liability-classified stock options:

Equity-Classified Options - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for awards under the 2013 Plan granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as equity-classified awards as employees are no longer permitted to satisfy their personal tax liability in excess of the minimum statutory withholding. Equity-classified stock option awards are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value of each award. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines the fair value of the options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date. This methodology requires significant inputs including the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and expiration date. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the equity-classified stock options:

As of March 31, 2017, there was a total of $2.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity-classified stock option awards that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 2.9 years. The weighted average grant fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $7.81, $0.00, and $0.00, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million, respectively. There were no options exercised during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Restricted Stock 
On September16, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the restricted stock plan, which provides for the issuance of restricted stock awards to certain key employees. The restricted stock generally vest ratably over a five-year period from the original restricted stock grant date, contingent on the employees continuous employment by ADS. In certain instances, however, a portion of the grants vested immediately or for accounting purposes were deemed to have vested immediately, including the grants to the Chief Executive Officer, which do not have a substantial risk of forfeiture as a result of different vesting provisions. Under the restricted stock plan, vested shares are considered issued and outstanding. Employees with restricted stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights on non-forfeited shares.
Prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically repurchased shares from employees within six months of the shares vesting. As such, for the periods prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering, the restricted stock awards were accounted for as liability-classified awards. In the periods subsequent to the initial public offering, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. discontinued repurchasing employee held restricted shares due to the existence of a public market for the shares. Accordingly, upon the initial public offering ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has modified the restricted stock awards from being accounted for as liability-classified to equity-classified awards and reclassified the carrying amount of the awards of $4.8 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock has been accounted for as equity-classified awards for the periods subsequent to the initial public offering. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March31, 2017.

At March31, 2017, there was approximately $3.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock that will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of 2.4 years. During the fiscal year ended March31, 2017, the weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock granted was $24.20. No restricted stock was granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. During the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the total fair value of restricted stock that vested was $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan
On June18, 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amended its then-existing Stockholders Agreement to authorize 0.3 million shares of restricted stock to be granted to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The shares typically will vest one year from the date of issuance. Under this stock plan, the vested shares granted are considered issued and outstanding. Non-employee directors with this stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights. 
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has determined that the restricted stock granted to directors should be accounted for as equity-classified awards. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million and 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March31, 2017 and 2016.
The following table summarizes information about the unvested Non-Employee Director Compensation stock grants as of March 31, 2017:

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s effective tax rate will vary based on factors, including but not limited to, overall profitability, the geographical mix of income before taxes and discrete events.The fiscal 2015 effective tax rate exceeded the federal statutory rate due in part to the significant permanent differences associated with non-deductible ESOP stock appreciation and stock-based compensation expense, the effect of which was increased by the near break-even amount of pre-tax income, whereas the fiscal year 2017 and 2016 effective tax rates more closely approximate a normal effective tax rate for ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC..

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on approximately $28.0 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries at March31, 2017 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely with the exception of cash dividends paid by ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s ADS Mexicana joint venture. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of U.S. tax that might be payable on the eventual remittance of such earnings.
Accounting for Uncertain Tax Positions
As of March31, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had unrecognized tax benefit of $6.2 million, which if resolved favorably, would reduce income tax expense by $6.2 million. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 is as follows:

The unrecognized tax benefits are primarily recorded in Other liabilities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Consolidated Balance Sheets. These amounts include potential accrued interest and penalties of $1.8 million and $2.7 million at March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
It is reasonably possible that there could be a change in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to activities of the IRS or other taxing authorities, including proposed assessments of additional tax, possible settlement of audit issues, or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitation.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently open to audit under the statute of limitations by the IRS for the fiscal years ended March31, 2014 through March31, 2017. The majority of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s state income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended March31, 2014 through March31, 2017. The foreign income tax returns are open to audit under the statute of limitations for the years ended March31, 2013 through March31, 2017.

Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Earnings Per Share [Abstract]
Net Income (Loss) Per Share
20.
NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE
Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing the Net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without consideration for common stock equivalents. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the Net income (loss) available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock equivalents outstanding for the period.
Holders of unvested restricted stock have non-forfeitable rights to dividends when declared on common stock, and holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock participate in dividends on an as-converted basis when declared on common stock. As a result, unvested restricted stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock meet the definition of participating securities, which requires us to apply the two-class method to compute both basic and diluted net income (loss) per share. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that treats participating securities as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common stockholders.
The dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted stock is based on the more dilutive of the treasury stock method or the diluted two-class method. In computing diluted net income per share, income available to common stockholders used in the basic net income per share calculation (numerator) is adjusted, subject to sequencing rules, for certain adjustments that would result from the assumed issuance of potential common shares. Diluted net income per share assumes the redeemable convertible preferred stock would be cash settled through the effective date of the IPO on July25, 2014, as ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has the choice of settling in cash or shares and it has demonstrated past practice and intent of cash settlement. Therefore these shares are excluded from the calculation through the effective date of the IPO. After the effective date of the IPO, managements intent is to share settle; therefore, these shares are included in the calculation from July26, 2014 through March31, 2017, if dilutive. For purposes of the calculation of diluted net income per share, stock options and unvested restricted stock are considered to be potential common stock and are only included in the calculations when their effect is dilutive.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s redeemable common stock is included in the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted net income per share.
The following table presents information necessary to calculate net income (loss) per share for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, as well as potentially dilutive securities excluded from the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Dividends on Common Stock - During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of common stock. The dividend is payable on June15, 2017 to stockholders of record at the close of business on June5, 2017.
Liability-classified stock awards  On April 1, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. modified all outstanding awards to remove the provision that permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability with the net settlement of shares in excess of minimum tax withholding. Consistent with the accounting standard update in Note 1, employees can now withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory rate.
Revolving Credit Facility Waiver  On May 19, 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. obtained a waiver from the lenders of the Revolving Credit Facility regarding an event of default. A material domestic subsidiary failed to join as a guarantor resulting in default. The lenders agreed to waive the default if the material domestic subsidiary joins as a guarantor by July 31, 2017.

Accounting Policies [Abstract]
Principles of Consolidation
Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC., its wholly owned subsidiaries, its majority owned subsidiaries, and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is the primary beneficiary. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments where it exercises significant influence but does not hold a controlling financial interest. Such investments are recorded in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the related equity in earnings from these investments are included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Estimates
Estimates - The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingencies and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include, but are not limited to, the allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of inventory, useful lives of property, plant and equipment and amortizing intangible assets, determination of the proper accounting for leases, valuation of equity method investments, goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment, accounting for stock-based compensation and the ESOP, valuation of the redeemable common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock, determination of allowances for sales returns, rebates and discounts, determination of the valuation allowance, if any, on deferred tax assets, and reserves for uncertain tax positions. Managements estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience, current conditions and available information. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates.
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Receivables and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts - Receivables include trade receivables, refundable income taxes and other miscellaneous receivables, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables at March31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows:

Credit is extended to customers based on an evaluation of their financial condition and collateral is generally not required. The evaluation of the customers financial condition is performed to reduce the risk of loss. Accounts receivable are evaluated for collectability based on numerous factors, including the length of time individual receivables are past due, past transaction history with customers, their credit worthiness and the economic environment. This estimate is periodically adjusted when management becomes aware of a specific customers inability to meet its financial obligations (e.g., bankruptcy filing) or as a result of changes in historical collection patterns.
Inventories
Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s inventories are maintained on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Costs include the cost of acquiring materials, including in-bound freight from vendors and freight incurred for the transportation of raw materials, tooling or finished goods between ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s manufacturing plants and its distribution centers, direct and indirect labor, factory overhead and certain corporate overhead costs related to the production of inventory. The portion of fixed manufacturing overhead that relates to capacity in excess of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s normal capacity is expensed in the period in which it is incurred and is not included in inventory. Market value of inventory is established based on the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, with consideration given to deterioration, obsolescence, and other factors. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically evaluates the carrying value of inventories and adjustments are made whenever necessary to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value.
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Method
Property, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation Method - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of assets acquired through acquisitions, which are initially recorded at fair value. Equipment acquired under capital lease is recorded at the lower of fair market value or the present value of the future minimum lease payments. Depreciation is computed for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the lease term, if shorter, as follows:
Years
Buildings
40  45
Machinery and equipment
3  18
Leasehold improvements
Shorter of useful life or life of lease
Costs of additions and major improvements are capitalized, whereas maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. When assets are retired or disposed, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the asset accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in Loss on disposal of assets and costs from exit and disposal activities in ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Construction in progress is also recorded at cost and includes capitalized interest, capitalized payroll costs and related costs such as taxes and other fringe benefits. Interest capitalized was $0.6 million, $0.4 million, and $0.5 million during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Goodwill
Goodwill - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records acquisitions resulting in the consolidation of an enterprise using the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records the assets acquired, including intangible assets that can be identified, and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price in excess of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. The goodwill impairment analysis is comprised of two steps. The first step requires the comparison of the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its respective carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not considered impaired and ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting units goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would record an impairment loss equal to the difference. With respect to this testing, a reporting unit is a component of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. for which discrete financial information is available and regularly reviewed by management. Implied fair value of goodwill is determined by considering both the income and market approach. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and determination of appropriate market comparables. The fair value estimates are based on assumptions management believes to be reasonable, but are inherently uncertain. For the fiscal 2017, ADS completed a quantitative fair value assessment of the International reporting unit and determined no impairment charge was required. 
GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of the Domestic reporting unit in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the Domestic reporting unit exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed. ADS applied the qualitative assessment to the Domestic reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for goodwill in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Intangible Assets - Definite-Lived
Intangible Assets Definite-Lived- Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, and are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts of the asset group may not be recoverable. Asset groups are established primarily by determining the lowest level of cash flows available. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of such assets, an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the fair value of the asset less any costs of disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
Intangible Assets - Indefinite-Lived
Intangible Assets Indefinite-Lived- Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually as of March31 or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may be greater than fair value. Determining the fair value of these assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain. To estimate the fair value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses an income approach, which utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance. An impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.
GAAP allows entities testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment the option of performing a qualitative assessment before calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets for the impairment test. If the qualitative assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible assets unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ADS completed a quantitative fair value measurement of indefinite-lived trademarks in March 31, 2016. The test indicated that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trademarks substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed.
ADS applied the qualitative assessment to specific trademarks for the annual impairment test performed as of March 31, 2017. For the current year test, ADS assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its March 31, 2016 quantitative fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that the trademarks fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. did not incur any impairment charges for Intangible assets in the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Other Assets
Other Assets - Other assets include investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method, cash surrender value of officer life insurance on key senior management executives, capitalized software development costs, deposits, Central parts, and other miscellaneous assets. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. capitalizes development costs for internal use software. Capitalization of software development costs begins in the application development stage and ends when the asset is placed into service. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amortizes such costs using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of 2 to 10 years, which is included in General and administrative expense, Selling expense or Cost of goods sold within the Consolidated Statements of Operations depending on the nature of the asset and its intended use. Central parts represent spare production equipment items which are used to replace worn or broken production equipment parts and help reduce the risk of prolonged equipment outages. The cost of Central parts is amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of 8 to 30 years.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount might not be recoverable, and recognizes an impairment loss when a decline in value below carrying value is determined to be other-than-temporary. Under these circumstances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. would adjust the investment down to its estimated fair value, which then becomes its new carrying value. For the fiscal years ended March31, 2017 and 2016, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recorded an impairment charge of $1.3 million and $4.0 million, respectively, related to its investment in the South American Joint Venture. The impairment charge is included in Equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliates in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. See Note 10. Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates.

Leases
Leases - Leases are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. uses the lower of the rate implicit in the lease or its incremental borrowing rate in the assessment of lease classification and assumes the initial lease term includes cancellable and renewal periods that are reasonably assured. For leases classified as capital leases at lease inception, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records a capital lease asset and lease financing obligation equal to the lesser of the present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair market value of the leased asset. The capital lease asset is recorded in Property, plant and equipment, net and amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term using the straight-line method, and the lease financing obligation is amortized using the effective interest method over the lease term with the rental payments being allocated to principal and interest. For leases classified as operating leases, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. records rent expense over the lease term using the straight-line method.
Foreign Currency Translation
Foreign Currency Translation - Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the current rate of exchange on the last day of the reporting period. Revenues and expenses are translated at a monthly average exchange rate and equity transactions are translated using either the actual exchange rate on the day of the transaction or a monthly average historical exchange rate. For the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) consisted entirely of foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Net Sales
Net Sales - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. sells pipe products and related water management products. ADS ships products to customers predominantly by internal fleet and to a lesser extent by third-party carriers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not provide any additional revenue generating services after product delivery.
Sales, net of sales tax and allowances for returns, rebates and discounts are recognized from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. ADS recognizes revenue when both persuasive evidence of an arrangement and the price is fixed or determinable. Title to the products and risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon delivery. ADS performs credit check procedures on all new customers, establishes credit limits accordingly, and monitors the creditworthiness of existing customers, which is the basis for concluding that collectability is reasonably assured.
Shipping Costs
Shipping Costs - Shipping costs are incurred to physically move raw materials, tooling and products between manufacturing and distribution facilities and from production or distribution facilities to customers. Shipping costs for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $120.4 million, $120.5 million, and $121.0 million, respectively, and are included in Cost of goods sold. In certain instances, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. bills shipping costs to customers. Shipping costs billed to customers were $5.5 million, $7.0 million, and $9.3 million during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and are included in Net sales.
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-Based Compensation - See Note18. Stock-Based Compensation for information about ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s stock-based compensation award programs and related accounting policies.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has several programs for stock-based payments to employees and directors, including stock options and restricted stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in General and administrative expenses, Selling expenses and Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognized stock-based compensation expense (benefit) in the following line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:

Stock Options
Liability-Classified Options  Prior to fiscal 2017, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. permitted employees to satisfy their personal tax liability associated with the exercise of the stock options through the net settlement of shares in excess of the minimum tax withholding required by law. In addition, prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had periodically repurchased shares resulting from option exercises within six months of the exercise date. As such, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for all 2000 Plan and 2013 Plan awards issued prior to fiscal 2017 as liability-classified awards.
Liability-classified stock option awards are re-measured at fair value at each relevant reporting date, and the pro-rata vested portion of the award is recognized as a liability. The stock-based compensation liability associated with stock options expected to vest within the next twelve months is recorded in Current portion of liability-classified stock-based awards, with the portion related to those expected to vest beyond twelve months recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When stock options are exercised, the liability is reclassified to additional paid in capital at fair value. The proceeds from the exercise are also recorded as additional paid in capital.
Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. For liability-classified options, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. estimates the fair value of stock options using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the end of each period. The following table summarizes the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of liability-classified stock options:

2000 Plan - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s 2000 stock option plan (2000 Plan) provides for the issuance of statutory and non-statutory stock options to management based upon the discretion of the Board of Directors. The plan generally provides for grants with the exercise price equal to fair value on the date of grant, which vest in three equal annual amounts beginning in yearfive and expire after approximately 10years from issuance. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 1.1 million shares available for grant under the 2000 Plan as of March 31, 2017.

As of March31, 2017, there was a total of $0.3 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards under the 2000 plan that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 1.3 years.
The total fair value of liability-classified options issued under the 2000 Plan that vested during the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 was $8.1 million. No options vested during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal year ended March31, 2015 was $6.76. No options were granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and currently exercisable as of March31, 2017 was $1.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $3.7 million, $3.7 million and $3.4 million, respectively.
2013 Plan - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s 2013 stock option plan (2013 Plan) provides for the issuance of non-statutory common stock options to management subject to the Boards discretion. The plan generally provides for grants with the exercise price equal to fair value on the date of grant. The grants generally vest in five equal annual amounts beginning in year one and expire after approximately 10 years from issuance. Options issued to the Chief Executive Officer vest equally over fADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s years and expire after approximately 10 years from issuance.
In May 2014, the Board of Directors approved the increase of shares available for granting under the 2013 plan to 1.4 million shares. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had 1.0 million shares available for grant under the 2013 Plan as of March31, 2017.

As of March31, 2017, there was a total of $3.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock option awards under the 2013 Plan that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 1.1 years.
The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and currently exercisable as of March31, 2017 was $14.4 million and $9.3 million, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $3.4 million, $3.6 million, and $7.2 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 was $0.8 million. 
Equity-Classified Options - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accounts for awards under the 2013 Plan granted during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 as equity-classified awards as employees are no longer permitted to satisfy their personal tax liability in excess of the minimum statutory withholding. Equity-classified stock option awards are measured based on the grant-date estimated fair value of each award. Compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines the fair value of the options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model at the grant date. This methodology requires significant inputs including the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock, risk-free interest rate, dividend yield and expiration date.

As of March 31, 2017, there was a total of $2.6 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested equity-classified stock option awards that will be recognized as an expense as the awards vest over the remaining weighted average service period of 2.9 years. The weighted average grant fair value of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $7.81, $0.00, and $0.00, respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 were $0.1 million, less than $0.1 million, and less than $0.1 million, respectively. There were no options exercised during the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
Restricted Stock 
On September16, 2008, the Board of Directors adopted the restricted stock plan, which provides for the issuance of restricted stock awards to certain key employees. The restricted stock generally vest ratably over a five-year period from the original restricted stock grant date, contingent on the employees continuous employment by ADS. In certain instances, however, a portion of the grants vested immediately or for accounting purposes were deemed to have vested immediately, including the grants to the Chief Executive Officer, which do not have a substantial risk of forfeiture as a result of different vesting provisions. Under the restricted stock plan, vested shares are considered issued and outstanding. Employees with restricted stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights on non-forfeited shares.
Prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering in fiscal 2015, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. periodically repurchased shares from employees within six months of the shares vesting. As such, for the periods prior to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s initial public offering, the restricted stock awards were accounted for as liability-classified awards. In the periods subsequent to the initial public offering, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. discontinued repurchasing employee held restricted shares due to the existence of a public market for the shares. Accordingly, upon the initial public offering ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has modified the restricted stock awards from being accounted for as liability-classified to equity-classified awards and reclassified the carrying amount of the awards of $4.8 million to Paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The restricted stock has been accounted for as equity-classified awards for the periods subsequent to the initial public offering. The fair value of restricted stock is based on the fair value of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s common stock. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the employees requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the grant.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March31, 2017.
The information about the unvested restricted stock grants as of March31, 2017 is as follows:

ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects all restricted stock grants to vest.
At March31, 2017, there was approximately $3.5 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to the restricted stock that will be recognized over the weighted average remaining service period of 2.4 years. During the fiscal year ended March31, 2017, the weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock granted was $24.20. No restricted stock was granted during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2016 and 2015. During the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the total fair value of restricted stock that vested was $1.2 million, $1.1 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan
On June18, 2014, ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. amended its then-existing Stockholders Agreement to authorize 0.3 million shares of restricted stock to be granted to non-employee members of its Board of Directors. The shares typically will vest one year from the date of issuance. Under this stock plan, the vested shares granted are considered issued and outstanding. Non-employee directors with this stock have the right to dividends on the shares awarded (vested and unvested) in addition to voting rights. 
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has determined that the restricted stock granted to directors should be accounted for as equity-classified awards. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. had approximately 0.2 million and 0.2 million shares available for grant under this plan as of March31, 2017 and 2016.
The following table summarizes information about the unvested Non-Employee Director Compensation stock grants as of March 31, 2017:

Advertising
Advertising - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expenses advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs are recorded in Selling expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The total advertising costs were $3.1 million, $3.2 million, and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Self-Insurance
Self-Insurance - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for short term disability and medical coverage it provides for substantially all eligible employees. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is self-insured for medical claims up to the individual and aggregate stop-loss coverage limits. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. accrues for claims incurred but not reported based on an estimate of future claims related to events that occurred prior to the fiscal year end if it has not met the aggregate stop-loss coverage limit. Amounts expensed totaled $39.5 million, $37.5 million, and $32.0 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, of which employees contributed $5.1 million, $4.5 million, and $4.1 million, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for various other general insurance programs to the extent of the applicable deductible limits on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s insurance coverage. These programs include primarily automobile, general liability and employment practices coverage with deductibles ranging from $0.3 million to $0.5 million per occurrence or claim incurred. Amounts expensed during the period, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported at year end, were $1.8 million, $2.1 million, and $0.6 million, for the years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
ADS is also self-insured for workers compensation insurance with stop-loss coverage for claims that exceed $0.3 million per incident up to the respective state statutory limits. Amounts expensed, including an estimate for claims incurred but not reported, were $2.1 million, $3.9 million, and $1.4 million for the fiscal years ended March31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Income Taxes
Income Taxes - Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized and represent the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. They are measured using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the related temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The deferred income tax provision represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Penalties and interest recorded on income taxes payable are recorded as part of Income tax expense.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. determines whether an uncertain tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation process, based upon the technical merits of the position. For tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold, the tax amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant taxing authority.
Fair Values
Fair Values -The fair value framework requires the categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon assumptions (inputs) used to price the assets or liabilities. Level1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:
Level1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level2 Observable inputs other than those included in Level1. For example, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.
Level3 Unobservable inputs reflecting managements own assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.
ADSs policy for determining when transfers between levels have occurred is to use the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer.
Concentrations of Risk
Concentrations of Risk - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has a large, active customer base of approximately twenty thousand customers with two customers, Ferguson Enterprises and HD Supply Waterworks, each representing more than 10% of annual net sales. Such customers accounted for 23.5%, 21.1%, and 20.3% of fiscal year 2017, 2016 and 2015 net sales, respectively. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s customer base is diversified across the range of end markets that it serves.
Financial instruments that potentially subject ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. to a concentration of credit risk consist principally of Receivables. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. provides its products to customers based on an evaluation of the customers financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. Exposure to losses on Receivables is principally dependent on each customers financial condition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. monitors the exposure for credit losses and maintains allowances for anticipated losses. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to Receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s customer base and their dispersion across many different geographies. One customer, Ferguson Enterprises, accounted for approximately 15.7% and 14.0% of Receivables at March31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Derivatives
Derivatives - ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measure those instruments at fair value. ADS uses interest rate swaps, commodity options in the form of collars and swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage various exposures to interest rate, commodity price, and exchange rate fluctuations. These instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and therefore, gains and losses from contract settlements and changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are recognized in Derivative losses (gains) and other expense (income), net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s policy is to present all derivative balances on a gross basis.
ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. also has forward purchase agreements in place with certain resin suppliers for virgin polyethylene resin. The agreements specify a fixed amount of virgin resin material to be purchased at a fixed price for a given period of time in quantities ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will use in the normal course of business, and therefore, are not subject to the guidance provided in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 810-15Consolidation. The cost of such resin is recognized in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
Consolidation  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update to make changes to consolidation guidance to address concerns of stakeholders that current accounting for certain legal entities might require a reporting entity to consolidate another legal entity in situations in which the reporting entitys contractual rights do not give it the ability to act primarily on its own behalf, the reporting entity does not hold a majority of the legal entitys voting rights, or the reporting entity is not exposed to a majority of the legal entitys economic benefits or obligations. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April1, 2016. The update has had no effect on the consolidated financial statements.
Debt Issuance Costs  In April 2015, the FASB issuedan accounting standards update that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures will include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that provided supplemental guidance that the SEC would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These updates are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2015, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard effective April1, 2016 on a retrospective basis. See Note 12. Debt for additional information about the impact of the adoption of the updates.
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities  In November 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires entities to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities, as well as any related valuation allowance, as non-current, rather than separately record the current and non-current portions. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. The amendments in this update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted this standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis and prior periods have not been adjusted. The impact of the adoption of this standard was a reduction to the net current deferred tax assets balance included in Deferred income taxes and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets from $11.7 million as of March 31, 2016 to zero as of March 31, 2017, with all deferred tax assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2017 now being classified as non-current. The update had no effect on ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Consolidated Statements of Stockholders Equity and Mezzanine Equity.
Internal-Use Software  In April 2017 the FASB issued an accounting standards update to provide guidance to customers concerning whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. Under this new standard, 1) if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for in a manner consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses, or 2) if the arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. The standard will take effect for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim reporting periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. adopted the new standard on April 1, 2016 on a prospective basis. The update did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted
Revenue Recognition  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for revenue recognition. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that an entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for goods or services. The amendment sets forth a new revenue recognition model that requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations. In August 2015, the FASB issued an additional accounting standards update that deferred the effective date of the new revenue standard for public entities to periods beginning after December15, 2017, with early adoption permitted but not earlier than the original effective date of periods beginning after December15, 2016. There have also been various additional accounting standards updates issued by the FASB in 2016 that further amend this new revenue standard. The updated standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.
Measurement of Inventory  In July 2015, the FASB issuedan accounting standards update which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, simplifying current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. The determination of market value, under current guidance, is considered unnecessarily complex as there are several potential outcomes based on its definition as replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximate normal profit margin. Whereas net realizable value, under the update, is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This update is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. does not expect the adoption of this new standard to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.
Leases  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which amends the guidance for leases. This amendment contains principles that will require an entity to recognize most leases on the balance sheet by recording a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, unless the lease is a short-term lease that has an accounting lease term of twelve months or less. The amendment also contains other changes to the current lease guidance that may result in changes to how entities determine which contractual arrangements qualify as a lease, the accounting for executory costs such as property taxes and insurance, as well as which lease origination costs will be capitalizable. The new standard also requires expanded quantitative and qualitative disclosures. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. The updated standard requires the use of the modified retrospective transition method, whereby the new guidance will be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements of the period of adoption. The modified retrospective transition approach includes certain practical expedients that entities may elect to apply in transition. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2019. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has not yet determined whether to apply any of the available practical expedients. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. has begun the process of reviewing contracts under the new standard to determine the impact the new standard will have on the consolidated financial statements. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is also in process of implementing a new software solution to improve the process of accounting for leases under the current and new standard.
Stock-Based Compensation  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which is intended to simplify certain aspects of the accounting for stock-based compensation. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will adopt the standard on April 1, 2017. This update contains changes to the accounting for excess tax benefits, whereby excess tax benefits will be recognized in the income statement rather than in additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. This standard is expected to result in increased volatility to the income tax expense in future periods dependent upon the timing of employee exercises of stock options, the price of ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s common stock and the vesting of restricted stock awards. Excess tax benefits will now be classified as operating cash flows rather than financing cash flows.
The amendment also contains potential changes to the accounting for forfeitures, whereby entities can elect to either continue to apply the current GAAP requirement to estimate forfeitures when determining compensation expense, or to alternatively reverse the compensation expense of forfeited awards when they occur. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. will account for forfeitures as they occur, which may result in expense volatility based on the timing of forfeitures.
In addition, the amendment also modifies the net-share settlement liability classification exception for statutory income tax withholdings, whereby the new guidance allows an employer with a statutory income tax withholding obligation to withhold shares with a fair value up to the maximum statutory tax rate in the employees applicable jurisdiction. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. included this provision in awards issued in fiscal 2017 and modified previously issued awards on April 1, 2017. See the note regarding Subsequent Events for further information on the modification.
Measurement of Credit Losses  In June 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments, including trade receivables. This accounting standards update requires the use of an impairment model referred to as the current expected credit loss model. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2019, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Cash Flow Classification  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which provides amended guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows, including related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance and distributions received from equity method investees. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption is permitted. This amended guidance must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented, but may be applied prospectively if retrospective application would be impracticable. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Definition of a Business In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to clarify the definition of a business. The definition of a business affects many areas of accounting including acquisitions, disposals, goodwill, and consolidation. The amendments are intended to help companies and other organizations evaluate whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The amendments provide a more robust framework to use in determining when a set of assets and activities is a business.The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December15, 2017, including interim periods within those periods. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April1, 2018. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which removes the requirement to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount as part of step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. As a result, under the standards update, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value; however, the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effect for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. expects to adopt this standard effective April 1, 2020. ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC. is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on the consolidated financial statements.
With the exception of pronouncements described above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements that have significance, or potential significance, to ADVANCED DRAINAGE SYSTEMS, INC.'s consolidated financial statements.

- DefinitionTabular disclosure of temporary equity. Temporary equity is a security with redemption features that are outside the control of the issuer, is not classified as an asset or liability in conformity with GAAP, and is not mandatorily redeemable. Includes any type of security that is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price or on a fixed or determinable date or dates, is redeemable at the option of the holder, or has conditions for redemption which are not solely within the control of the issuer. If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.

- DefinitionThis element represents the current and noncurrent portions of a long-term real estate loan with an initial maturity beyond one year or beyond the normal operating cycle, if longer, to finance building costs. The funds are disbursed as needed or in accordance with a prearranged plan; generally, a portion of the funds is disbursed at inception and the remainder as construction progresses. The money is repaid on completion of the project (generally one to seven years), usually from the proceeds of a mortgage loan. The rate is normally higher than the prime rate, and there is usually an origination fee. The effective yield on these loans tends to be high, and the lender has a security interest in the real property.

- DefinitionDescribes the way transactions affect unearned shares (or any other form of unearned equity). Unearned ESOP shares are credited as shares and are committed to be released based on the cost of the shares to the ESOP. Employers charge or credit the difference between the fair value of shares committed to be released and the cost of those shares to the ESOP to shareholders' equity in the same manner as gains and losses on sales of treasury stock (generally to additional paid-in capital). If the employer has both old ESOP shares and new ESOP shares that are accounted for differently, in accordance with the accounting guidance which existed at the time and with respect to each block of shares, the accounting policies for both blocks of shares are described.

The ESOP documents typically define the period of service to which the shares relate. ESOP shares are released to compensate employees directly, to settle employer liabilities for other employee benefits, and to replace dividends on allocated shares that are used for debt service.

- DefinitionAmount to be paid per share that is classified as temporary equity by entity upon redemption. Temporary equity is a security with redemption features that are outside the control of the issuer, is not classified as an asset or liability in conformity with GAAP, and is not mandatorily redeemable. Includes any type of security that is redeemable at a fixed or determinable price or on a fixed or determinable date or dates, is redeemable at the option of the holder, or has conditions for redemption which are not solely within the control of the issuer. If convertible, the issuer does not control the actions or events necessary to issue the maximum number of shares that could be required to be delivered under the conversion option if the holder exercises the option to convert the stock to another class of equity. If the security is a warrant or a rights issue, the warrant or rights issue is considered to be temporary equity if the issuer cannot demonstrate that it would be able to deliver upon the exercise of the option by the holder in all cases. Includes stock with put option held by ESOP and stock redeemable by holder only in the event of a change in control of the issuer.

- DefinitionNumber of operating segments. An operating segment is a component of an enterprise: (a) that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same enterprise), (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the enterprise's chief operating decision maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and (c) for which discrete financial information is available. An operating segment may engage in business activities for which it has yet to earn revenues, for example, start-up operations may be operating segments before earning revenues.
